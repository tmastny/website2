      <description>Introduction Data Cleaning My Methodology Future Work   Introduction Greg Nuckols, a powerlifting coach, graduate student, and all around smart guy just did an excellent meta-analytic study on periodization methods in strength training on his website Strong By Science. If your not sure what periodization (or strength training) is, I would encourage you to read Greg’s article and explore his website. In this blog post I would like to focus on the statistical content of Greg’s article.</description>

      <description>Introduction Why Tidy? The Data Cleaning Conclusions   Introduction I’d like this post to be an introduction to cleaning and preparing a messy spreadsheet as part of a data science pipeline. Instead of presenting a finished script that takes a messy spreadsheet and outputs a tidy one, I want to emphasize the exploratory nature data cleaning. My approach will follow Hadley Wickham’s in his tidy data paper. At the end, our data should satify these three characteristics:</description>

      <description>Introduction The Data Tidying Variables Tidying Poststratification  Model 1: Disaggragation Model 2: Maximum Likelihood Multilevel Model Model 3: Full Bayesian Model Model Comparisons   Introduction In the last post I wrote the “MRP Primer” Primer studying the p part of MRP: poststratification. This post explores the actual MRP Primer by Jonathan Kastellec. Jonathan and his coauthors wrote this excellent tutorial on Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) using r-base and arm/lme4.</description>

      <description>Introduction Another example The Total Statistic The Total and Weighted Averaging  Conclusion   Introduction This post will introduce poststartification: the process of correcting non-representative samples to better reflect the actual population proportions. There are some excellent resources to learn about multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP or Mister P), but most are heavy on multilevel regression and light on poststratification.
My next blog post will dive into the MRP Primer by Jonathan Kastellec using tools such as Stan, brms, and tidybayes.</description>
