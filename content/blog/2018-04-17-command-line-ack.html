<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted, but I’ve been staying busy with some other projects that I’ll talk about soon. One thing I’ve been dealing with is <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate">R</a> <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/leadr">packages</a> and Kaggle <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/uno_ml_contest2">contests</a>. Both have a lot of code that I need to search through.</p>
<p>For example, I’ll often google how to solve a problem and implement the solution. Days, weeks, or months later I’ll encounter the problem again and realize I solved it before. Shortcuts like <code>command-f</code> are nice to search within a file, but don’t help if you are in the wrong file.</p>
<p>Here’s a few ways I’ve learned how to efficiently search through text files.</p>
</div>
<div id="rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio</h2>
<p>RStudio also has an incredibly useful tool to search through text files. Most people are familiar with <code>command-f</code> for searching through files; <code>shift-command-f</code> launches a window to search through files.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/find-in-files.png" width="400" /></p>
<p>You can also customize the search type for certain extensions, or to exclude stuff like <code>.html</code> or <code>.md</code> which hides duplicate results if you work with a lot of knitr.</p>
<p>In the console page, a window of all the results will pop up:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/console-window.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>And the best part: if you click a line in the console window, it will open that file at that line in the text editor.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/editor.png" /><!-- --></p>
</div>
<div id="command-line" class="section level2">
<h2>Command-line</h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm">command-line bullshitery</a>. Command-line tools can definitely be intimidating<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and arcane, but even the author admits they are useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So perhaps what is more important to a researcher than programming ability is adeptness at dealing with command-line bullshittery, since that enables one to become 10x or even 100x more productive than peers by finding, installing, configuring, customizing, and remixing the appropriate pieces of free software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course this discussion isn’t complete with a rebuttal: <a href="https://medium.com/@eytanadar/on-the-value-of-command-line-bullshittery-94dc19ec8c61">On the Value of Command-Line “Bullshittery”</a>. Either way, you may be interested in some ways the command-line can help.</p>
</div>
<div id="ack" class="section level2">
<h2>ack</h2>
<p><a href="https://beyondgrep.com/">ack</a> is a nice command-line tool that smartly searches through plain-text. For example, let’s look through one of my Kaggle contest <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/uno_ml_contest2">repos</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ack step_</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/ack1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>It has nice grouping, coloring, and highlighting.</p>
<p>We can even specify .R files with <code>--rr</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ack --rr step_</code></pre>
<p>There are many other <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/documentation/">parameters</a> that helps you filter and customize the search. If you are working with blogdown or with knitr, <code>--nohtml</code> is useful to limit to source files rather than outputs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ack --nohtml step_</code></pre>
<p>And while you can’t click the file to open the in RStudio, you can use a little command-line magic<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to open the files in editors that support the command-line like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>atom $(ack --rr -l step_)</code></pre>
<p>As before <code>--rr</code> to filter on .R files, and <code>-l</code> returns just the file names that contain a match, which Atom opens.</p>
<div id="searching-file-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Searching File Names</h3>
<p>So far ack has feature parity with RStudio’s <code>command-shift-f</code>. However, one really useful feature of ack is searching for text in file names, which doesn’t have a nice parallel in RStudio. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ack -g create</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/ack2.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>And you can send these off to an editor like before:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>atom $(ack -g create)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="github" class="section level2">
<h2>Github</h2>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to point out that Github’s built-in search function for repos is actually pretty effective. I’ve been learning <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/knitr">knitr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/reticulate">reticulate</a>, and searching for code with Github has been very useful. The search also includes commits and issues, which may provide some context to the source code.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I remember when a professor suggested I run <code>man grep</code> to answer my question. I couldn’t even figure out how to close the window and had to restart my terminal. It <em>is</em> a learnable skill though. I can now understand some pieces of <code>man</code> pages.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Unfortunately Atom doesn’t support piping, so <code>ack --r -l brm | atom</code> doesn’t work (<a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1729">yet!</a>).<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
