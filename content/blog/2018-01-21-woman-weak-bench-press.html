<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For raw meet data, see this website: <a href="http://www.openpowerlifting.org/" class="uri">http://www.openpowerlifting.org/</a> and their Github: <a href="https://github.com/sstangl/openpowerlifting" class="uri">https://github.com/sstangl/openpowerlifting</a></p>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greg Nuckols looked at relative differences between men and women. Men tend to squat and deadlift roughly 50-60% more than woman, but bench 114% more. Why do men bench disproportionally more than women, compared to the other competitive lifts?</li>
<li>Could it have something to do with their absolute amount of lean bodymass?

<li>Bench press strength related to upper-body thickness

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a really good idea I need to find some time to work on. First, I want to fit a model (allometric) to the men’s data. Then I input the women’s weights (controlling for their body %) and use graphical posterior predictive checks to generate what the model thinks women should be capable of, and compare it to what they actually are capable of.</p>
