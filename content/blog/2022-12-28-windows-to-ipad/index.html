<p>I recently got an iPad and I’d like to use it to write some code.
I found the app <a href="https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell">a-shell</a>
was the best way to get code running locally on my iPad. The terminal
app provides custom builds of Python, C, Vim, git, ssh: most of the things
you need to get started. But I was still frustrated by the limitations.
What I really wanted was VSCode and the ability to install and build
any software.</p>
<p>My plan was to use my Windows 10 PC as a server that hosted VSCode, and
connect to that server with the iPad so I could use VSCode in the browser.
I found this <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1587451857143828481?s=20&amp;t=dmvAeCnrovMO2NrpyI3WLg">tweet</a>
to be a nice overview of ssh as I was trying to set
everything up.</p>
<div id="windows-setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Windows Setup</h2>
<p>First, I installed Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>run powershell as administrator</li>
<li><code>wsl --install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I need to setup my PC as a server. Luckily, Windows 10 now comes
with the ability to install OpenSSH directly. I found this
<a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-ssh-into-a-windows-10-machine-from-linux-or-windows-or-anywhere">tutorial</a> to work.</p>
<p>I also found that setting up the private keys was a little tricky.
You’ll have to edit <code>ssh_config</code> to find the location of
<code>ssh\administrators_authorized_keys</code>.
Here are two resources I found useful:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/windows-ssh-access.html" class="uri">https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/windows-ssh-access.html</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="wsl" class="section level3">
<h3>WSL</h3>
<p>On WSL, you’ll now need to install <a href="https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/install#installsh">code-server</a>
to host VSCode.</p>
<p>The major limitation with WSL is that it doesn’t have <code>systemctl</code>, or at least
not in the same way as normal Ubuntu. There are ways to get around
this limitation, but I ended up ignoring it and deploying
the service manually each time I ssh’d into the machine. I’ll
explain more in the iPad section.</p>
<p>Lastly, before I jump to the iPad I recommend installing
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git">Git on Windows for WSL</a> if you haven’t already.
This is not strictly needed to ssh onto the machine, but you’ll
want it setup so you can use git as you would normally.</p>
<p>It’s also a good time to set it up with a credential store:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper &quot;/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-store.exe&quot;</code></pre>

<h2>iPad</h2>
<p>Next, you’ll need an app to ssh to the machine. You can use a-Shell
as I recommended before, but my favorite app is Terminus.</p>
<p>Terminus is the most useful app for ssh, because it allows you to turn
on location services. This seems strange at first, but by
turning location services on, it prevents the ssh connection from ending
while you switch between apps.</p>
<p>Next, inside Terminus, you’ll need to generate connect to your server
(<code>whoami</code> and <code>ipconfig</code> on the Windows machine will help you find
your IP address) and you’ll need to setup your ssh key.</p>
<p>If the connection was successful, you should see the bash shell
(or powershell if you didn’t <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-ssh-into-a-windows-10-machine-from-linux-or-windows-or-anywhere">customize</a> the default shell. If in powershell,
just run `bash.exe).</p>
<p>From there, run <code>code-server</code> to deploy your VSCode server.</p>
<p>In Terminus, setup portforwarding to 8080. That way when you visit <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in Safari, you’ll be connected to VSCode!
In Safari, you can also click on Share, Add to Homescreen to create a
VSCode app.</p>
