                      results='show', cache=FALSE, autodep=FALSE)

urchins %>%
  group_by(food_regime) %>%

    across(everything(), mean), n = n()

mean(urchins$width)
ggplot2::cut_interval(urchins$initial_volume)'
```

### Github

And typically this is highlight.js github theme:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

urchins <- read_csv("https://tidymodels.org/start/models/urchins.csv") %>%
  setNames(c("food_regime", "initial_volume", "width")) %>%
  mutate(food_regime = factor(food_regime, levels = c("Init", "Low", "High")))

urchins %>%
  group_by(food_regime) %>%
  summarise(
    across(everything(), mean), n = n()
  )

mean(urchins$width)
ggplot2::cut_interval(urchins$initial_volume)
```

### RStudio

### Unique highlighting

There is also the highlight [R package](https://github.com/romainfrancois/highlight),
which does semantic highlighting, where words have
unique coloring depending on the context.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(highlight)
highlight(code, detective = sherlock()) %>% cat()
```

pandoc themes. They are conclusively covered here,
so I won't provide a full array: https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/pandoc-syntax-highlighting-examples/

### Themes and Parsing

Client-side and server-side.

### Commonalities

Save for the unique semantic highlight, there we can find commonalities along
two dimensions: themes and syntax.

Themes are primarily designed around colors, but even then there isn't
a lot of consistency between implementations.

And then there are the parsing rules. These rules decide what token gets
highlighted.
