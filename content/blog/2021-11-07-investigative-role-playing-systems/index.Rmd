## Introduction

Investigative role-playing games add role-playing systems to a game
of deduction.

[Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder),
[Her Story](http://www.herstorygame.com/),
and [Contradiction](https://baggycat.com/contradiction/)
are examples of deduction games. Players only progress deduce the meaning of
the clues they have.

With investigative role-playing, the players want to role-play a character.
It's perfectly valid to play *Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective* while
pretending to be other characters, but that approach is limiting.
Players want to play characters with skills they don't possess: casting spells,
knowledge of ancient history, or handling weapons.
Likewise, my player and I want to experience archetypal mystery encounters like car chases, shootouts, and fist fights.
A role-playing system provide rules to use skills and resolve encounters.

I think [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/) is a great system
for these type of games.

Finally, I include a role-playing system used to resolve conflicts and provide constraints.
In this article, I'll show why I think [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/) systems
like [Trail of Cthulhu](https://pelgranepress.com/product/trail-of-cthulhu/) are best.

Throughout this article, I'll refer to three systems:
- [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/)
- [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex)
- [Lasers and Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/)

## Investigation

Failing to find a clue derails the campaign and isn't fun, as Justin Alexander
writes in [Three Clue Rule](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)
This isn't a problem with Gumshoe, because investigation skills and abilities always succeed.

Justin [Node-Based Design](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach)
is also worth a read, if you are interested in creating or running your own investigation games.

## encounters

The purpose of the system is to resolve encounters.

To make it fun, the encounters should feel tense--see my other post.

For my games of investigative role playing,
I want to the system to be simple to learn and encounters to be quick to resolve.
Within these constraints we want to maximize the tension.

DnD is ill fitting: it’s complex and combat notoriously takes forever.
Lasers and Feelings is fast, but there are only two points of mechanical tension.
The onetime decision point of setting your score and the single dice roll to resolve your encounter.

Gumshoe systems are a great middle ground.
Character creation is simple (and getting simpler with modern variants).
The rules are designed so the dice rolls are always driven by the player,
but can be lead by the DM so they don’t need to know an exhaustive list of rules.

Gumshoe has a few mechanics designed to increase tension in encounters.
Like most RPGs, it uses dice rolls to introduce random chance.

The standout element is the point pool.
Each ability, like firearms has a certain number of points a player
can add your their role before the result is known.
This heightens tension through both cost and decision complexity.
The point pool, like spell slots in 5e, is a limited resource that can’t be restored in the middle of an encounter.
Players also have to decide how much to spend from there poll, not simply whether to spend it,
adding additional complexity tension to the encounter.

The tension of cost is real, as you worry you might need them later.
And this is combined with an additional decision point: you have to decide the number of points to spend.
You can even spend enough points to guarantee a success, although at great cost to your pool.

Gumshoe forces players to consider the cost and how much they are willing to spend in the moment.

This system gives the players a surprising amount of control.
During the encounter they must decide: the ability to use, whether to spend points,
and the number of points, and then the role.
Each encounter feels tense because you really want to make the right decision.
All are a significant decision that adds tension, yet is simple.

DND 5e, by contrast, is incredibly complex, yet often the mechanical tension is limited only to a dice roll.
In certain classes or situations, the best a character can do is a straightforward attack each round that doesn’t even have a cost.
The phrase “I guess I’ll attack” doesn’t bring a lot of attention.
