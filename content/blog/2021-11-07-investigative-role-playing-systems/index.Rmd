## Introduction

Investigative role-playing games add role-playing systems to a game
of deduction.

[Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder),
[Her Story](http://www.herstorygame.com/),
and [Contradiction](https://baggycat.com/contradiction/)
are examples of deduction games. Players only progress deduce the meaning of
the clues they have.

With investigative role-playing, the players want to role-play a character.
It's perfectly valid to play *Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective* while
pretending to be other characters, but that approach is limiting.
Players want to play characters with skills they don't possess: casting spells,
knowledge of ancient history, or handling weapons.
Likewise, my player and I want to experience archetypal mystery encounters like car chases, shootouts, and fist fights.
A role-playing system provide rules to use skills and resolve encounters.

I think [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/) is a great system
for these type of games.

## Introduction


There are two components to investigative role-playing:
progress is made by logical deduction from a set of clues
and players role-play a character with skills and abilities they don't possess.

In games of pure logical deduction, such as
[Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder),
[Her Story](http://www.herstorygame.com/),
and [Contradiction](https://baggycat.com/contradiction/),
progress is only accomplished by following clues.
But deduction is only part of a great mystery story; car chases, shootouts, and
fist fights all add to the excitment.

By adding a role-playing system onto of a deduction game, the system allows players
to role-play characters with skills and abilities they don't possess,
and provides rules to resolve encounters.

In the games I lead the clues and mystery are center stage, not the gameplay encounters.
Encounters propel the story in surprising ways and create tension and excitement.
But I don't want the complexity and length of the encounters to overshadow the
narrative. Within these constraints I want the rules to maximize the tension.

To demonstrate how the Gumshoe system maximizes tension with simple rules,
I'll analyze it and similar systems using the encounter-model I introduced in my [last post](https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/how-game-mechanics-create-tension/).





## Why Gumshoe?

Character creation is simple (and getting simpler with modern variants).
The rules are designed so the dice rolls are always driven by the player,
but lead by the DM so players don’t need to know an exhaustive list of rules.
Investigative abilities always work; players can't miss out on a clue because of a bad roll.
But my favorite feature of Gumshoe is the point spends.

Before each roll, a player can choose to spend a number of points from their poll
to add to their result. They could add 0 points, making it a coin flip, or 7 guaranteeing
a success with the max DC^[Difficulty class, or the minimum number a player must roll to succeed.] of 8.
Like spell slots in DnD 5e, the points are a limited resource and have to last
for multiple encounters.

The [cost is a palpable source of tension in my games](https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/how-game-mechanics-create-tension/).
Players agnoize over how much to spend. They worry about how many points to save
for future encounters and about a random failure failure occuring
despite their spend. This feature really augments the tension
set by the narrative.

The system also gives the players a surprising amount of control.
During the encounter they must decide: the ability to use, whether to spend points,
and the number of points to spend. Then they roll.
Each decision simple and fast, but offer enough complexity
to feel the weight of the choice. Moreover, the points offer a sense of power,
giving them the option for a guaranted success.

By constrast, in D&D 5e mechanical tension is often limited to a single dice roll
with no cost or risk.
In certain situations, the best a character can do is a basic attack.
The phrase “I guess I’ll attack” tells me my players don't feel in control and
don't feel the tension.

Worse, D&D 5e takes a long time to learn and combat is [notoriously slow](https://slyflourish.com/tips_to_speed_up_combat.html).
Given these reasons, I don't like to use D&D 5e for role-playing investigations.

## What is Gumshoe?

For a quick overview of the system, .
Also see Shut Up & Sit Down's
of Trail of Cthulhu, a system based on Gumshoe.

I'll assume familarity with the system in the next section.

## Encounters

The purpose of a role-paying system is to resolve encounters and for encounters
to be fun and memorable they should feel tense. In [my last post](https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/how-game-mechanics-create-tension/)
I explored the way rules create tension. Let's see how Gumshoe is designed to generate tension.

For my games of investigative role playing,
I want to the system to be simple to learn and encounters to be quick to resolve.
Within these constraints we want to maximize the tension.
