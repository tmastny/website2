## Introduction

Investigative Role-playing is a combination of a deduction game
and a role-playing system.

Justin Alexander wrote a series of articles on designing the investigation
elements, explaining the theory of [Node-Based Design](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach)
and promoting the [three clue rule](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule).

To supplement his guidelines on designing investigations,
this article explains the role-playing rules and systems.


## Goals of Investigative Role-Playing

Investigative Role-playing is more than logical deductions from a set of clues,
as is found in games like [Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder).
The players want to role-play a character they came up with.

Why does there need to be a role-playing system that administrats the role-playing?
Could the players just pretend to be characters in a normal deduction game?

That's a valid approach, but it's limiting.
Players want to play characters with skills they don't possess: casting spells,
knowledge of ancient history, or handling weapons. Likewise, players and Dungeon Masters
want typical mystery encounters like car chases, shootouts, and fist fights.
A role-playing sysem offers fair, predictive rules to use skills and resolve encounters.

is also a good resource that explains Gumshoe point spend in more detail.



I'm want to use a system that maximizes tension and minimizing complexity.


Fail forward







Finally, I include a role-playing system used to resolve conflicts and provide constraints.
In this article, I'll show why I think [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/) systems
like [Trail of Cthulhu](https://pelgranepress.com/product/trail-of-cthulhu/) are best.

Throughout this article, I'll refer to three systems:
- [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/)
- [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex)
- [Lasers and Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/)
