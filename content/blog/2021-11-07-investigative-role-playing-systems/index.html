<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In a classic mystery story, the heroes follow a trail of clues
to solve the case. But deduction is only part of the tale:
car chases, shootouts, and
fist fights all add to the excitment.</p>
<p>Investigative role-play games capture all elements of the mystery story.
The DM creates a world with logical, consistent clues for the players to follow.
The players role-play an investigator with unusual skills and abilities.
And the role-playing system states how players can use their character’s abilities to
find clues and engage in encounters.</p>
<p>In the investigation games I lead, clues and mystery take center stage, not the gameplay encounters.
Encounters propel the story forward in surprising ways, creating tension and excitement.
But I don’t want the complexity and length of the encounters to overshadow the
narrative. And within these constraints I want the gameplay mechanics to maximize the tension.</p>
<p>Given these requirements, I think the <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/">Gumshoe system</a>
is great. The system’s small set of rules can create tense encounters,
rivaling complicated systems like D&amp;D 5e.</p>

<div id="why-gumshoe" class="section level2">
<h2>Why Gumshoe?</h2>
<p>Character creation is simple (and getting simpler with modern variants).
The rules are designed so the dice rolls are always driven by the player,
but lead by the DM so players don’t need to know an exhaustive list of rules.
Investigative abilities always work; players can’t miss out on a clue because of a bad roll.
But my favorite feature of Gumshoe is the point spends.</p>
<p>Before each roll, a player can choose to spend a number of points from their poll
to add to their result. They could add 0 points, making it a coin toss, or 7 guaranteeing
a success with the max DC<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of 8.
Like spell slots in DnD 5e, the points are a limited resource and have to last
for multiple encounters.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/how-game-mechanics-create-tension/">cost is a palpable source of tension in my games</a>.
Players agnoize over how much to spend. They worry about how many points to save
for future encounters and about a random failure failure occuring
despite their spend. This feature really augments the tension
set by the narrative.</p>
<p>The system also gives the players a surprising amount of control.
During the encounter they must decide: the ability to use, whether to spend points,
and the number of points to spend. Then they roll.
Each decision simple and fast, but the set offers enough complexity
to feel the weight of the choice. Moreover, the points offer a sense of power,
giving them the option for a guaranted success.</p>
<p>By constrast, in D&amp;D 5e mechanical tension is often limited to a single dice roll
with no cost or risk.
In certain situations, the best a character can do is a basic attack.
The phrase “I guess I’ll attack” tells me my players don’t feel in control and
don’t feel the tension.</p>
<p>Worse, D&amp;D 5e takes a long time to learn and combat is <a href="https://slyflourish.com/tips_to_speed_up_combat.html">notoriously slow</a>.
Given these reasons, I don’t like to use D&amp;D 5e for role-playing investigations.</p>
