<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Investigative Role-playing is a combination of a deduction game
and a role-playing system.</p>
<p>Justin Alexander wrote a series of articles on designing the investigation
elements, explaining the theory of <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach">Node-Based Design</a>
and promoting the <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule">three clue rule</a>.</p>
<p>To supplement his guidelines on designing investigations,
this article explains the role-playing rules and systems.</p>

<h2>Goals of Investigative Role-Playing</h2>
<p>Investigative Role-playing is more than logical deductions from a set of clues,
as is found in games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder">Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective</a>.
The players want to role-play a character they came up with.</p>
<p>Why does there need to be a role-playing system that administrats the role-playing?
Could the players just pretend to be characters in a normal deduction game?</p>
<p>That’s a valid approach, but it’s limiting.
Players want to play characters with skills they don’t possess: casting spells,
knowledge of ancient history, or handling weapons. Likewise, players and Dungeon Masters
want typical mystery encounters like car chases, shootouts, and fist fights.
A role-playing sysem offers fair, predictive rules to use skills and resolve encounters.</p>

is also a good resource that explains Gumshoe point spend in more detail.</p>
<p>I’m want to use a system that maximizes tension and minimizing complexity.</p>
<p>Fail forward</p>
<p>Finally, I include a role-playing system used to resolve conflicts and provide constraints.
In this article, I’ll show why I think <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/">Gumshoe</a> systems
like <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/product/trail-of-cthulhu/">Trail of Cthulhu</a> are best.
<a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/rpg-review-trail-of-cthulhu/">Shut Up &amp; Sit Down</a></p>
<p>Throughout this article, I’ll refer to three systems:
- <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/">Gumshoe</a>
- <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex">Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition</a>
- <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/">Lasers and Feelings</a></p>
