<p>As a Dungeon Master (DM), I want characters to solve challenges with their personality and skills.
I design campaigns with this in mind.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article, I propose a tension-resolution framework for role-playing games.
Furthermore, I will show that we can use the framework to improve mechanics for
investigative role-playing.</p>

<h2>Investigative Role-Playing</h2>
<p>Here’s how I like to run investigative role-playing games. I begin with a hook or premise.
The players create a character movitated to investigate the hook.
I populate the world with clues. And the <em>players</em> decipher the
clues to unravel the mysteries.</p>
<p>The characters collect the clues, but the players have to connect the dots.
Similar to deduction games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder">Sherlock Holms Consultin Detective</a>.
Players can’t roll to make me to explain the clues for them. So I ensure the clues
are internally consistent, lead to a conclusion, <em>and</em> that the players can figure it out.

on running investigations.</p>
<p>Finally, I include a role-playing system used to resolve conflicts and provide constraints.
In this article, I’ll show why I think <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/">Gumshoe</a> systems
like <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/product/trail-of-cthulhu/">Trail of Cthulhu</a> are best.</p>
<p>I’m want to use a system that maximizes tension and minimizing complexity.</p>

<h2>Tension-Resolution Framework</h2>
<p>Investigative role-playing is a combination of two genres.
Deduction games, such as ,
and mechanical dice-based role-playing systems such as <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex">D&amp;D 5e</a>.</p>
<p>Deduction elements provide mystery, logical puzzles, and a sense of progress by collecting clues.
The role-playing systems offer gaming mechanics such as random chance, resource management, and abilities
These mechanics resolve conflict and provide role-playing constraints.</p>
<p>My campaign, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MvkKUkErnCAqWb7d8IaEQ8uJMS_XocKlCmDPT_sZzE/edit?usp=sharing">The Curse on Moonlight Bay</a>,
is a good example about what I am trying to achieve with an investigative role-playing system.</p>
<p>Each campaign starts with a hook or premise. In The Curse on Moonlight Bay, there are 3:
- an exocrist has gone missing
- prohibition gangsters are smuggling liquor
- the hospital claims they have a cure for mass hysteria</p>
<p>The players create a character movitated to investigate the hook.
I populate the world with internally consistent clues. And the <em>players</em> decipher the
clues to unravel the mysteries.</p>

<p>Sidebar: the characters collect the clues, but the players have to connect the dots.
Players can’t roll to make me to explain the clues for them. So the Dungeon Master
has to put in a lot of work ahead of time to sure the players can solve the mystery.

<p>Gaming mechanics</p>
<p>For the deduction to be rewarding, the clues must be internally consistent and lead to a logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Mechnical elements need to be simplified enough that the don’t overwhelm and render
the deduction elements useless.</p>
