[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is an awesome book by
[Robert Nystrom](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/) about interpeters, compilers, and
programming languages. I love this book, because it teaches you how to build *2*
interpeters line-by-line: a tree-walking interpeter in Java and then a bytecode virtual machine in C.

In [Chapter 26](https://craftinginterpreters.com/garbage-collection.html),
he builds a mark-and-sweep garbage collector, and does a fantastic
job explaining the algorithm with detailed diagrams and illastrations.

But I also wanted to understand how our *implementation* of mark-and-sweep worked,
not just the algorithm. And there are some subtle naunces to our implementation.
So in this post, I'm going to clarify how the garbage collector works as implemented,
by examining a small toy-example he gives in the book and by going through a
slightly-larger program that actually collects some garbage.

First up, let's walk through an early example he shares in the chapter:
```js
var a = "first value";
a = "updated";
// GC here.
print a;
```
Robert explains that the string `"first value"` could be collected because there
is no variable referring to that value when the garbage collection runs on the 3rd line
(and the string isn't on the virtual machine's stack.)

It's true in an abstract sense that `"first value"` could be collected without
causing a problem, but the implementation works different^[Other [folks](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/issues/1068) were also confused by this example, since it differs from the actual implementation.]:
1. `"first value"` is never collected:
   - the compiler creates a top-level function (referred to as `<script>`) that saves
     `"first value"` in the constants table. The compiler functions are explicitly marked
     in `markCompilerRoots`, so the constants won't be collected.
  - After compilation, the function is converted to a closure and pushed on the
    virtual machine's stack. All stack variables are also marked, so `"first value"` will _really_
    never be collected.
2. garbage collection runs on object allocation, not between statements:
   - garbage collection is called in `reallocate`, either on every allocation if `DEBUG_STRESS_GC`
     is set, or when `vm.bytesAllocated > vm.nextGC`.

Here's a more direct example of Lox garbage collection:
```js
fun makeCounter(init) {
  var count = init;
  fun counter() {
    count = count + 1;
    return count;
  }

  return counter;
}

var c = makeCounter(0);
print c();

c = makeCounter(10);
print c();

c = makeCounter(20); // `makeCounter(0)` closure collected here.
print c();
```

Each time `makeCounter` is called, the following bytecode is executed:
```
== makeCounter ==
0000    2 OP_GET_LOCAL        1
0002    6 OP_CLOSURE          0 <fn counter>
0004      |                     local 2
0006    8 OP_GET_LOCAL        3
0008    | OP_RETURN
0009    9 OP_NIL
0010    | OP_RETURN
```

`OP_CLOSURE` allocates a new closure on the heap, pushing the value on the stack (safe from gc)
until it is assigned to the variable `c` via `OP_SET_GLOBAL` in `<script>`.
```c
      case OP_CLOSURE: {
        ObjFunction* function = AS_FUNCTION(READ_CONSTANT());
        ObjClosure* closure = newClosure(function);
        push(OBJ_VAL(closure));
```

After `makeCounter(10)` is assigned to `c`, the previous closure is
"dangling" (no object in Lox depends on it). But it won't be collected
until the next allocation.

We know `c = makeCounter(20);` will allocate an object, so garbage collection
will be called. But what will be collected? That depends on the order the
statement is parsed and executed. Luckily, we can refer to the bytecode logging:
```
0031   17 OP_GET_GLOBAL      11 'makeCounter'
0033    | OP_CONSTANT        12 '20'
0035    | OP_CALL             1
0037    | OP_SET_GLOBAL      10 'c'
0039    | OP_POP
```

`OP_CALL` calls `makeCounter` which, as I noted above, will call `OP_CLOSURE`
and allocate an object. This happens _before_ we assign the new closure to `c`.
So deep in `markRoots` when we call `markTable(&vm.globals)`, `c` is still
associated with the closure returned by `makeCounter(10)`. So both are marked
and are safe from collection.

Therefore, the only closure collected is the one returned from `makeCounter(0)`.
And that's what we see in the gc logs:
```
0x131704b50 free type 4
0x131704b20 free type 0
-- gc end
   collected 96 bytes (from 2084 to 1988) next at 397
```
`type 0` is the 0th `ObjType enum` which refers to closures.
We also need an object of type 4, which is the `upValue` used by
the closure (in this case, an `ObjUpvalue` wrapping the `Value` 0).

> Note in `makeCounter`, the starting value of the counter
can be set with `init`. This is a helpful way to see why
you need to allocate new closures on each call, even though the
underlying function `count` is the same: each one "closes" around
a different value.

It was really fun to work through Lox's mark-and-sweep
implementation in detail. I walked away with a better
understanding of compilers and garbage collection.
