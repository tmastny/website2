<p><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> is an awesome book by
<a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/">Robert Nystrom</a> about interpreters, compilers, and
programming languages. I love this book, because it teaches you how to build <em>2</em>
interpreters line-by-line: a tree-walking interpreter in Java and then a bytecode virtual machine in C.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/garbage-collection.html">Chapter 26</a>,
he builds a mark-and-sweep garbage collector and does a fantastic
job explaining the algorithm with detailed diagrams and illustrations.</p>
<p>But I also wanted to understand how our <em>implementation</em> of mark-and-sweep worked,
not just the algorithm.
So in this post, I’m going to clarify how the garbage collector works as implemented,
by examining a small toy-example he gives in the book and by going through a
slightly-larger program that actually collects some garbage.</p>
<p>First up, let’s walk through an early example he shares in the chapter:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var a = &quot;first value&quot;;
a = &quot;updated&quot;;
// GC here.
print a;</code></pre>
<p>Robert explains that the string <code>"first value"</code> could be collected because there
is no variable referring to that value when the garbage collection runs on the 3rd line
(and the string isn’t on the virtual machine’s stack).</p>
<p>It’s true in an abstract sense that <code>"first value"</code> could be collected without
causing a problem, but the implementation works different<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>"first value"</code> is never collected:
<ul>
<li>the compiler creates a top-level function (referred to as <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>) that saves
<code>"first value"</code> in the constants table <em>during compilation</em>.
The compiler functions are explicitly marked
in <code>markCompilerRoots</code>, so the constants won’t be collected.</li>
<li>After compilation, that function is converted to a closure and pushed on the
virtual machine’s stack. All stack variables are also marked, so <code>"first value"</code> will <em>really</em>
never be collected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>garbage collection runs on object allocation, not between statements:
<ul>
<li>garbage collection is called in <code>reallocate</code>, either on every allocation if <code>DEBUG_STRESS_GC</code>
is set, or when <code>vm.bytesAllocated &gt; vm.nextGC</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>"updated"</code> is never allocated (at runtime):
<ul>
<li>like <code>"first value"</code>, <code>"updated"</code> is allocated at compile time and put in the
constants table. So the reassignment at runtime wouldn’t cause a new allocation
anyway.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example where garbage needs to be collected:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>fun makeCounter(init) {
  var count = init;
  fun counter() {
    count = count + 1;
    return count;
  }

  return counter;
}

var c = makeCounter(0);
print c();

c = makeCounter(10);
print c();

c = makeCounter(20); // `makeCounter(0)` closure collected here.
print c();</code></pre>
<p>Each time <code>makeCounter</code> is called, the following bytecode is executed:</p>
<pre><code>== makeCounter ==
0000    2 OP_GET_LOCAL        1
0002    6 OP_CLOSURE          0 &lt;fn counter&gt;
0004      |                     local 2
0006    8 OP_GET_LOCAL        3
0008    | OP_RETURN
0009    9 OP_NIL
0010    | OP_RETURN</code></pre>
<p><code>OP_CLOSURE</code> allocates a new closure on the heap, pushing the value on the stack (safe from gc)
until it is assigned to the variable <code>c</code> via <code>OP_SET_GLOBAL</code> in <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>      case OP_CLOSURE: {
        ObjFunction* function = AS_FUNCTION(READ_CONSTANT());
        ObjClosure* closure = newClosure(function);
        push(OBJ_VAL(closure));
        ...</code></pre>
<p>So we want to check each call to <code>makeCounter</code> to see if anything is being
collected.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>First, we don’t expect any garbage to be collected when <code>c</code> is initialized.
<code>c</code> has no prior value that could go unreferenced, and this is the first time
<code>makeCounter</code> is called.</p>
<p><code>c = makeCounter(10);</code> is more subtle. We know it allocates an object, but is
anything collected? You might think that the closure returned from
<code>makeCounter(0)</code> would be collected. To know for sure, we need to examine
the order the statement is executed. Luckily, we can refer to bytecode logging:</p>
<pre><code>0017   14 OP_GET_GLOBAL       7 &#39;makeCounter&#39;
0019    | OP_CONSTANT         8 &#39;10&#39;
0021    | OP_CALL             1
0023    | OP_SET_GLOBAL       6 &#39;c&#39;
0025    | OP_POP</code></pre>
<p><code>OP_CALL</code> will run the <code>makeCounter</code> bytecode which will run <code>OP_CLOSURE</code>
and allocate an object. This happens <em>before</em> we assign the new closure to <code>c</code>.
So deep in <code>markRoots</code> when we call <code>markTable(&amp;vm.globals)</code>, <code>c</code> is still
associated with the closure returned by <code>makeCounter(0)</code>. So both are marked
and are safe from collection.</p>
<p>Therefore, nothing is collected!</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with <code>c = makeCounter(20);</code>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
At the time of collection, <code>c</code> is associated with the closure from <code>makeCounter(10)</code>,
so that one is is not collected.
But the closure from <code>makeCounter(0)</code> is <strong>not</strong> marked as safe,
so it’s collected and freed!</p>
<p>And that’s what we see in the gc logs:</p>
<pre><code>0x131704b50 free type 4
0x131704b20 free type 0
-- gc end
   collected 96 bytes (from 2084 to 1988) next at 397</code></pre>
<p><code>type 0</code> is the 0th <code>ObjType enum</code> which refers to closures.
We also see an object of type 4, which is the <code>upValue</code> used by
the closure (an <code>ObjUpvalue</code> wrapping the <code>Value</code> 0).</p>
<p>A recurring theme in the book
is the difference between an abstract specification of the language and the
real implementation. It is cool to see a small slice of this in two small
examples.</p>
<p>It was also really fun to work through Lox’s mark-and-sweep
implementation in detail, because I love stepping through functions
with a debugger and tracing the path through a program. I always
learn so much about the program and the language when I do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note in <code>makeCounter</code>, the starting value of the counter
can be set with <code>init</code>. This is a helpful way to see why
you need to allocate new closures on each call, even though the
underlying function <code>counter</code> is the same: each one “closes” around
a different value.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Other <a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/issues/1068">folks</a> were also confused by this example, since it differs from the actual implementation.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn3"><p>Nothing special about
running <code>makeCounter</code>. Any object allocation would trigger gc. However,
as of Chapter 26, the only other object allocation we can do in Lox besides
closures is string concatenation! Everything else is allocated at compile time,
funny enough.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
