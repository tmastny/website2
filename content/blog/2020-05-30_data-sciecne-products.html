<h2>DevOps</h2>
<p>DevOps is the set of practices and tools that make an organization’s
ability to deliver products better and more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-science-products" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Science Products</h2>
<p>Data models
- clean, consistent, performant representations of business data</p>
<p>Business Analytics
- automatically computed metrics needed by organization
- ARR
- forecasts</p>
<p>Self-service Business Intelligence
- tools so everyone in the company can work gather their own data
- location for company wide dashboards</p>
<p>Data Analysis
- analyzing data to inform decision making</p>
</div>
<div id="data-analysis-products" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Analysis Products</h2>
<p>For data modeling, business analytics, and BI tools, Data Science DevOps
is similar to Software Engineering DevOps.</p>
<p>However, I argue that DevOps for Data Analysis is fundamentally different,
because the product is different. Instead of delivering a database table,
calculation, or service you are delivering <em>analysis</em>.</p>
<p>The type of <em>analysis</em> can vary. On one end it could simply be transferring
information or data. Like emailing a collegue a spreadsheet, or a screenshot
of a plot.</p>
<p>At this transactional level, if the process needs to be repeated, it can evolve
into a business analytics or BI product. Or if it’s only necessary one time,
you can move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>At the other end of analysis is insight. The stakeholder might not know what
they need, but they need data to inform a decision. The insight they are looking
for may require you to analyze historical trends to search for a pattern,
or combine data in unique ways.</p>
<p>And a spreadsheet or plot is rarely sufficient to communicate your findings.
You might produce a write-up, and after feedback that could evolve into a
presentation.</p>
<p>So the product of a data analysis is more ambigious. It’s likely an on-going,
evolving process fueled by feedback and direction from stakeholders.</p>
<p>I contend that even if the product is ambigious, the DevOps doesn’t have to be.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-analysis-devops" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Analysis DevOps</h2>
<p>To understand Data Analysis DevOps, we need to understand the high-level
requirements of analysis, and an understanding of the tools that can meet those
requirements in a better and more efficient way.</p>
<div id="process-requirements" class="section level3">
<h3>Process Requirements</h3>
<p>I think these 5 areas broadly cover the requirements of data analysis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Access to data</li>
<li>Tooling and Configuration</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Reproducibility and Review</li>
<li>Communication and Sharing</li>
</ol>
<p>Access to data is the first step. In some large organizations with heavy
regulatory requirements, this can actually be a very difficult and
time-consuming step. In other places, data is much more freely shared.</p>
<p>Here, I mean tooling and configuration to be the technology you need to analysis
the data. This could be Excel, R, or Python, with the necessary libraries
for the task at hand like visualizations, machine learning, or additional
data manipulation.</p>
<p>Analysis is the process and result of investigating the data. This includes
the code to manipulate and transform the data, and the software to generate
visualizations. But it also includes the narrative of your analysis, or
diagrams to explain a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>And reproducibility and review is the quality control on the analysis. That
the process is sound and the result is not spurious.</p>
<p>Finally, our stakeholders need to see it. And they also need to be able to give
feedback.</p>
</div>
<div id="technologies-and-efficiencies" class="section level3">
<h3>Technologies and Efficiencies</h3>
<p>The role of Data Analysis DevOps is twofold. First create, implement, and
improve the technology that facilitate the requirement.
Second, reduce the friction between technologies by making them more
robust and efficient.</p>
<p>Inefficients are driven by the type of analysis. For the right questions,
BI tools may be perfect: data access is granted, anyone can review the results,
and dashboards can be embedded in documentation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using the wrong tool can cause major inefficiencies
for both the creator and the reviewer.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img src="" /></p>
<p>Here’s the BI serves provides <em>access to data</em>, but it’s the wrong <em>tool</em>.
It doesn’t have the visualization functionality we need. So data must be
transfered between programs, and plots saved and loaded in a write-up.</p>
<p>To address these inefficiencies, we could design a process like this:</p>
<p><img src="" /></p>
<p>Inefficiencies
- am I manually downloading csvs?
- am I copy-pasting or screenshoting code?
- do reviewers have access to all my raw analysis?</p>
<p>Improvements
- do I have the right tool for the job?
- how easy is it to setup the right tools and configuration?</p>
<p>Data Science DevOps is about unification.
* unifying implementation of the product standardizes workflow for scientists.
This makes it easier to get started, and for others to review the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>unifying delivery is helpful for both the internal team and the stakeholders.
The initial delivery vehicle is clear for both the analysis and the
stakeholder. Communication is centralized and documented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we start to define this processes, we can build systems and tools
that make these more efficient.</p>

<div id="caveats" class="section level2">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. Sometimes all that is needed is a
spreadsheet and we can move on with our lives. But additional structure
and tooling can improve these complicated issues.</p>
