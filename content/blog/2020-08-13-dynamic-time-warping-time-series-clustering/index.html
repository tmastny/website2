<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Working with a <em>set</em> of time series measuring related observations
requires a different set of tools compared to analyzing or forecasting
a single time series.</p>
<p>If you want to cluster time series into groups with similar behaviors,
one option is feature extraction: statistical summaries that
characterize some feature of the time series, such as min, max, or
spectral density. The <a href="https://feasts.tidyverts.org/index.html">feasts</a> R package
and the Python package <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh">tsfresh</a>
provide tools to make this easier.</p>
<p>Why not cluster on the time series directly? Standard methods don’t work
as well, and can produce clusters that fail to capture visual similarities
in shape and size.</p>
<p>Dynamic time warping is method that aligns with intuitive notions of
time series similarity. To show how it works, I’ll walk through</p>

<h2>Distance Metrics</h2>
<p>To cluster, we need to measure the distance between every member of the group.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Typically we think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20Euclidean%20distance,metric%20as%20the%20Pythagorean%20metric.">Euclidean distance</a>:
the length of a straight line between two points.</p>
<p>This distance pops up all the time in data science,
usually in Mean Squared Error (MSE) or
it’s counterpart Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
These metrics are used to measure regression error in machine learning
and assess the accuracy of a <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html">time series forecast</a>.</p>

<p>To evaluate the fit of the forecast to the actual data,
you can calculate the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points
in the time series and the forecasts. The smaller the distance,
the better the forecast: the more <em>similar</em> the two series are.</p>
<p>A straight line between two points isn’t always the possible.
In a city grid, we are constrained by the blocks. In this situation, the distance
between two points is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan distance</a>.</p>
<p><img src="283px-Manhattan_distance.svg.png" width="142" /></p>
<p>Time series also
need a special distance metric. The most common is called Dynamic Time Warping.</p>
<div id="time-series-distance" class="section level3">
<h3>Time Series Distance</h3>
<p>Plotted below are three time series. I’ve plotted blue and green to both
overlap red. Is blue or green more similar to red?</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-08-13-dynamic-time-warping-time-series-clustering/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I think it’s blue: blue and red both has an early dip after 750.
Around 1000 they both have a slim, deep trough. The major difference is that
blue seems shifted to the left.</p>
<p>Green is all wrong: where red dips around 750, green has a bump.
And the dip after 1000 is wider and shallower.</p>
<p>The Euclidean distance tells a different story.
Red is actually closer to green, because it has a smaller distance metric
(9.78 vs 9.83).</p>
<pre><code>##           red    blue
## blue  9.83149        
## green 9.78531 9.82103</code></pre>

<h2>Dynamic Time Warping</h2>
<p>To capture our intuition about the similarity of red and blue,
we need a new metric. This metric can’t simply measure the point-to-point
distance between the series.
As we saw, blue is shifted to the left of red, even though the shape
is really similar. We need to <em>warp time</em> to account for this shift!</p>
<p>In the visualizations below<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
you can see how dynamic time warping stretches
(warps) time to match up nearby points.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-08-13-dynamic-time-warping-time-series-clustering/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>When comparing red to green below,
there is a lot more warping going on to match up
points (as measured by the light gray concentric lines between the series),
so the time series are more dissimilar.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-08-13-dynamic-time-warping-time-series-clustering/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The dissimilarity between red and green is reflected when we
calculate the dynamic time warping distance.</p>
<pre><code>##            red     blue
## blue  28.26073         
## green 33.82476 31.50148</code></pre>
