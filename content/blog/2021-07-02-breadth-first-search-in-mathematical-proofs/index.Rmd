## Introduction

In this article, I propose a tension-resolution framework for role-playing games.
Furthermore, I will show that we can use the framework to improve mechanics for
investigative role-playing.

## Investigative Role-Playing

Investigative role-playing is a combination of two genres.
Deduction games, such as [Sherlock Holms Consultin Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder),
and mechanical dice-based role-playing systems such as [D&D 5e](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex).

Deduction elements provide mystery, logical puzzles, and a sense of progress by collecting clues.
The role-playing systems offer gaming mechanics such as random chance, resource management, and abilities
used to resolve conflict (and provide role-playing constraints).



Mechnical elements need to be simplified enough that the don't overwhelm and render
the deduction elements useless.
