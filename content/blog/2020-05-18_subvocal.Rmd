## The Case Against _Anti-Subvocalization_

The [first article](https://irisreading.com/speed-reading-tips-5-ways-to-minimize-subvocalization/)
that comes up for me when I google `subvocalization` describes subvocalization
as follows:

> Subvocalization (also known as auditory reassurance) is a very common habit
  among readers. It involves saying words in your head while reading and itâ€™s
  one of the main reasons why people read slowly and have trouble improving
  their reading speed.


The implicit assumption is that you should be reading fast.
Fast means , more gamification on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com)



What about reading _for pleasure?_

When LifeHacker posted [10 Benefits of Reading: Why You Should Read Every Day](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-benefits-reading-why-you-should-read-everyday.html)
they didn't even think to put *because it's fun*. The closest they got
was `Free Entertainment`. What an endorsement.


Readers, or aspiring readers want a transactionable relationship with books.
If they consume them, they get something in return. Knowledge is one.
Nebulous self-help concepts like tranquilty and memory improvement.

But where are the articles about how to enjoy reading more? What if instead of
reading 52 books a year, we read one book really well?

## Subvocalization

I'm not convinced it actually works: Professor Elizabeth Schotter writes https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/magazine/speed-reading.html

> eye tracking study to show how people read faster


> The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to
  practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through
  increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of
  reading speed.

But even this, I don't really care about. I don't want to read faster,
I want to make reading more enjoyable. More fun.

## Reading as Pleasure

If you google "how to make reading fun," nearly every article is directed
at making reading fun for *children*. But adults need to have fun too.

In fact, I think the articles are pretty good, and applies to adults as well.
For example, Grade Power Learning identifies [13 tips](https://gradepowerlearning.com/how-to-make-reading-fun/).

The first three are advice anyone could follow:

1. Pick the right books. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. If you want to
   read for fun, don't pick a book you "should" read. Don't feel obligated to
   pick up *War and Peace*, or anything by Charles Dickens. Read something that
   sounds fun. If you don't know what sounds fun, you'll have to try multiple
   books. Stop reading it if it isn't good.

2. Read aloud. The speed readers should be very made, because reading aloud is
   ~2 times slower than reading for the average reader. But I think you should
   take this advice both literally and figuratively. I've had a lot of fun
   reading aloud to my wife during long road trips.

   But the real hard of this advice: **read in your head as if you were reading
   aloud**. Give your characters voices, accents, paces of speech. Listen
   and hear your characters speak. Let them have an voice, *beyond the text
   in the page*.


3. Act out the story. Take time to visualize the novel in your head. It's
   easy to pass over a line like

   > [descriptive line]

   but I want to be in the book. I want to feel like I'm on the mountain peek.
   I want to be bored, counting the same cieling tiles as the character.

   Doing this requires extra effort, and *slows you down*, but makes reading
   more fun.

## Reading as Performance

Points #2 and #3 are really about making reading a performance. Yes, books can
be a vehicle to consume knowledge, but they are at their most *fun* when you are
performing them.

You are the actors, director, and cinematographer^[As you start thinking deeply
about the book, I'd argue you also become the writer]. For some people, this
could feel intimidating. Not everyone took their, and has an eye for character.

But the best part about reading is that it all takes place in your head. You
can let all your inhibitions down, and be as silly, dramatic, or cold as you
want, because no one will know the difference.

And this all flies in the face of the anti-subvocalization folks.
