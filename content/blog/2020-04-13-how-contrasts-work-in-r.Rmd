## Introduction

Inspired by Jonas K. LindelÃ¸v's excellent website 

> [common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)

this post will walk through common statistical tests used when analyzing
categorical variables in R.

I'll cover 5 situations:

1. pairwise differences between members of a category
2. comparison to the overall category mean
3. pairwise differences *within* a category
4. consecutive comparisons of time-based or sequential factors
5. before-and-after comparisons


## ~~How to use contrasts in R~~

In short: don't bother.^[If you are really curious, you might find these posts about contrasts in R useful:<br>
  1. <http://www.clayford.net/statistics/tag/sum-contrasts/><br>
  2. <https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-and-interpreting-different-contrasts-in-linear-models-in-r/><br>

Like many before me, one of my stats classes technically "taught" me contrasts.
But I didn't get the point and using them was cumbersome, 
so I promptly ignored them for years.

Luckily for me, someone came along and fixed the situation: 
[`emmeans`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html).
`emmeans` frames contrasts as a question you pose to a model: 
you can ask for all pairwise comparisons and get back that. 
`lm` and `summary` treat the same problem as fitting abstract 
coefficients, and you are left to answer your own question. 

`emmeans` works with `lm`, `glm`,
and the Bayesian friends in
[`brms`](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and
[`rstanarm`](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstanarm),
so the process is applicable no matter the tool.

And you don't have to learn (much) about contrasts to take advantage of it.

## Pairwise differences

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height="300px"}
# ![](/blog/cat-pairwise.png)
knitr::include_graphics("/blog/cat-pairwise.png", error = FALSE)
```

The goal of this section is to look at pairwise differences
between values of a category.
The primary example will be pairwise differences in air time
between airlines.

We'll start the analysis by grabbing 100 random flights from the top 5 airlines,
using data from the `nycflights13` package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse, warn.conflicts = TRUE)
library(emmeans)
library(broom)
library(nycflights13)

set.seed(158)

flights <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  left_join(nycflights13::airlines)

top_carriers <- flights %>%
  count(name) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 5)

flights <- flights %>%
  filter(name %in% top_carriers$name) %>%
  mutate(across(c(name, month), as.factor)) %>%
  mutate(across(name, str_replace, " Inc.", "")) %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = case_when(
    between(sched_dep_time, 0, 1159) ~ "am",
    TRUE ~ "pm"
  )) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 100) %>%
  ungroup()
```

For each airline, we can we find the mean air time. But we also
want to test if the airlines differ significantly.

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(across(air_time, mean, na.rm = TRUE), n = n())
```

To figure this out, we'll fit a linear model using the airlines as predictors.

```{r}
lm_airlines <- lm(air_time ~ name, data = flights)
summary(lm_airlines)
```

The classic `lm`-to-`summary` workflow.
Notice that *American Airlines* is no-where to be found.
That's because it's the "default" category.
R calls this contrast `treatment` but the more common name is dummy encoding.

All the other `name[Airline]` rows in the table show the estimated change
in air time from *American Airlines*, and how confident the model is
on that change based on the p-value.

This tells us some nice stuff.
*ExpressJet Airlines* has much lower air time than American,
while United has a little more. But that's it.

We can't answer our questions about pairwise differences:

  * Are Delta and JetBlue really that different?
  * How do our two top airlines compare?
  * What about the bottom two?

To find all these pairwise differences, we need `emmeans::emmeans`:

```{r}
lm_airlines %>%
  emmeans(pairwise ~ name)
```

`emmeans` explicitly returns the estimated differences and p-values
for every combination of airlines.

We notice that the difference between the middle two airlines
Delta and JetBlue is not significant.
American has about 23 minutes less air time than United, but it's not significant either.
And not surprisingly, any difference over 35 minutes seems significant.

## Comparison to overall mean

![](/blog/cat-mean.png)

We might also be interested in comparing each airline not to each other,
but to the overall mean. This is useful for benchmarking the companies based
on which ones are above and below the overall average.

```{r}
lm_airlines %>%
  emmeans(eff ~ name) %>%
  pluck("contrasts")
```

Using average air time across airlines as a benchmark
for comparison, Delta and JetBlue fall right in the middle.
United and Delta lead, with ExpressJet trailing far behind.

We can also see how one company compares against all the others by using
the `del.eff` contrast:

```{r}
lm_airlines %>%
  emmeans(del.eff ~ name) %>%
  pluck("contrasts")
```

## Pairwise comparisons *within* groups

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height="300px"}
# ![](/blog/cat-pairwise-within.png)
knitr::include_graphics("/blog/cat-pairwise-within.png", error = FALSE)
```

It's common to check pairwise comparisons within groups. 
For example, you might want to see if students who attended 
an ACT prep class scored higher on the test than those who didn't. 
If students from multiple schools were eligible to take the prep class, 
you'd want to test the effect of the class within schools,
to control for variation.

Going back to air travel, it's pretty clear that flights are delayed longer 
for departure in the PM than in the AM.

```{r}
lm(dep_delay ~ time_of_day, data = flights) %>%
  tidy()
```

On average, flights in the PM are delayed 17 minutes longer
than flights leaving in the AM. And this difference is very significant.

But is this effect consistent across airlines?
Are some airlines performing better than others, or is there one bad airline causing
most of this delay?

The normal summary on linear regression doesn't answer these questions:

```{r}
lm_delay <- lm(dep_delay ~ name * time_of_day, data = flights)
tidy(lm_delay)
```

If we just looked at the p-values uncritically,
we might conclude that there are no significant differences
between AM and PM delays across the airlines, 
since the smallest p-value is around `0.1`.

But remember that by default `lm` is only computing the time difference
(the interactions) *relative* to `American Airlines`.

We don't care if the airlines differ from American:
we care how they compare to *themselves* in the morning and the evening.

Therefore, we need to do a pairwise comparison of AM and PM *within* each group:

```{r}
lm_delay %>%
  emmeans(pairwise ~ time_of_day | name) %>%
  pluck("contrasts")
```

Compared to `lm`, emmeans tell a completely different story.
We are confident that every airline, save American, has more delays in the PM.

It's also more clear why the default contrast in `lm` gave such a
different outlook. The magnitude of the differences between airlines
don't different all that much, ranging from -12 to -25. 
Those differences aren't significant when compared to American, 
but the differences from morning to night certainly are.


## Consecutive comparisons

![](/blog/cat-consec.png)

Consecutive comparisons frequently occur with yearly aggregations.
It's natural to ask how 2020 compares to 2019, and how 2019 compared to 2018.
Changes from year-to-year might be an effect of random variation,
or the company might want to measure the impact of a new release or strategy.

In my line of work, this is particularly important for usability testing.
For example, do users who started in 2018 find it easier to navigate a website,
compared to newer users who started in 2019?

In this section, we'll show how to do consecutive comparisons,
using airplane data as an example.

```{r}
planes <- nycflights13::planes %>%
  filter(year > 2003) %>%
  mutate(across(year, as.factor))
```

Let's analyze the average number of airplane seats per year.
More seats are great for airlines, because they can sell more tickets,
but travelers don't like being crammed and uncomfortable.

```{r}
planes %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(across(seats, mean, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(year))
```

It's pretty clear that this is a increasing year-over-year trend,
as a linear regression confirms:

```{r}
lm(seats ~ as.numeric(year), data = planes) %>%
  tidy()
```

But 2013, 2012, and 2011 look really similar. Let's see how significant those 
differences are by doing consecutive comparisons:


```{r}
lm_seats <- lm(seats ~ year, data = planes)

lm_seats %>%
  emmeans(consec ~ year) %>%
  pluck("contrasts")
```

Consecutive comparisons highlight the years where there were significant peaks
in the average number of airplanes seats: 2009 and 2011.

And like we thought, there is little change from 2011 to 2013.

## Before and after

![](/blog/cat-before-after.png)

The last type of contrast we'll talk about today is before and after mean
comparisons.
It's similar to consecutive comparisons, because it often only makes sense
for sequential factors like time.

This one's also unique, because the unit of comparison is not necessarily an
individual member of a category, but rather groups compared to other groups.

> Continuing with seats from the previous section, 
  an exampe of a before and after comparison
  would be comparing the mean number of seats from 2003 - 2008 
  to the mean number of seats from 2009 - 2013.

This type of analysis is useful for non-linear trends, where you want
to identity the change point (hence the name *before and after*).

Returning to delays, how much variation is there month-to-month?

As always, we'll run the tests using linear regression:

```{r}
lm_month <- lm(dep_delay ~ month, data = flights)
tidy(lm_month)
```
The default contrast tells us that month 7, July, has significantly longer delays than January.
But how does this average change over the course of the year?

```{r}
lm_month %>%
  emmeans(mean_chg ~ month)
```

As I mentioned before, this one is a little more complicated to understand.
Each row measures the difference using

> after_average - before_average

So row `7 | 8`, the first significant row, says that
the average delay from August to December is 11 minutes *lower* than
the average delay from January to August.

This indicates that August turning point in the year (the before and after moment),
when delays start to shrink.
