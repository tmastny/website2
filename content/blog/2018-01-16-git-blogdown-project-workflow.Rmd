```

## Introduction

Here's the scenario: I'm working on my project, using a git repo to track changes. I'm excited about the project or a certain result, and I'd like to tell everyone about it by making a blog post with blogdown.

But how do I utilize all the work I've already done in the project? I've curated the data, built the plots, and saved my complicated analysis as a [`.RDS` file](https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2012/04/01/saving-and-loading-r-objects/). I'd like to reuse that work, and as a one forum user put it "copying rmarkdown files is a nonstarter."

Inspired by [this discussion](https://community.rstudio.com/t/whats-your-blogdown-workflow-to-include-work-from-other-projects/1445) on the RStudio forum, I'd like to share my workflow that I use to blog about my projects with Hugo/blogdown/Netlify. We'll look at

- [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)  
- knitr [code externalization](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/externalization/)

I'll demonstrate this workflow by example. This [Github repo](https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow) will be the external project we'd like to blog about. And this very post is where we'd like to do it. This means you should also follow the `.Rmd` for this post found on my website's [Github repo](https://github.com/tmastny/website2/blob/master/content/blog/2018-01-16-git-blogdown-project-workflow.Rmd).

## git Setup

For our purposes, we'll assume your project repo exists Github. If you don't feel comfortable with command line `git clone/pull/add/commit/push`, I strongly recommend Jenny Bryan's bookdown on [git for R users](http://happygitwithr.com/index.html). The tutorial will teach you the basics of working with git locally and on Github.

The purpose of the submodule is to make the contents of your project easily available and accessible. We want your `.Rmd` posts to utilize all the data and functions without copy/pasting. And services like Netlify should be able tothe project's contents from their github repo without needing a local copy of the project's file in your website's repo. 

All this while maintaining version control and a connection to the project's origin/master so you can incorporate updates.

Note that if you build your own `public` folder to serve your website, you don't need to create a submodule and you can skip to the next section where I introduce `knitr::opts_knit(root.dir = '')`.

### Creating

I recommend putting the project submodule in the same directory as your blog post. All my blog posts live here:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
website2/content/blog
```

So that is where I want to put a copy of my project. We do that with the `submodule` command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Timothys-MacBook-Pro:blog Tim$ git submodule add https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow.git
Cloning into '/Users/Tim/website2/content/blog/git-blogdown-workflow'...
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
remote: Total 10 (delta 0), reused 7 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

When we `git add/commit/push` the changes to the [website2 repo](https://github.com/tmastny/website2) you'll notice that the folder icon has changed. This indicates that website's repo is now tracking the project's repo at a certain commit, rather than a copy of those files at a moment in time.

![](/blog/github_pic.png)

In fact, if you click the folder you will be taken to the [git-blogdown-workflow Github repo](https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow/tree/314984302b4e1576acf6a6af8edfcb69d702c3f8).

This is exactly what we want. Instead of being a static copy of the project's file, we have a version controlled copy that is linked to the master branch. Updates to the submodule are not pulled in automatically, however.

### Updating

On a normal git repo, to receive the latest changes to your local branch you use `git pull`. But `git pull` only brings in changes to the top level git repo, which is the website's repo. This is by design.

Imagine you write a post that includes content from a project submodule. Months later a teammate changes a project feature your blog post depends on. If the submodule was updated automatically with pull, your blog posts could break unexpectedly. 

Therefore, to avoid unexpected conflicts we need to explicitly receive updates from submodules.

The first method is to navigate to the submodule and use `git fetch/merge`. For example,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Timothys-MacBook-Pro:blog Tim$ cd git-blogdown-workflow/
Timothys-MacBook-Pro:git-blogdown-workflow Tim$ git fetch
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow
   3149843..e207121  master     -> origin/master
Timothys-MacBook-Pro:git-blogdown-workflow Tim$ git merge origin/master
Updating 3149843..e207121
Fast-forward
 plot_model.R | 10 ++++++++++
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 plot_model.R
```

Note that `git pull`, the shortcut for `git fetch/merge` used on normal git repos does not work for submodules.

Or if you want to update all your submodules, you can use the shortcut `git submodule update --remote`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Timothys-MacBook-Pro:blog Tim$ git submodule update --remote
Submodule path 'git-blogdown-workflow': checked out 'ce0d3a2f200eac6cd2a2980110137f7917e30b1d'
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 3), reused 5 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
From https://github.com/tmastny/periodization-meta-analysis
   b29483b..de596ae  master     -> origin/master
Submodule path 'periodization-meta-analysis': checked out 'de596aed6a5535f7f4cdd270644e7993625b3f78'
```

But remember, pulling unexpected changes from your submodules can break your blog posts. 

## Code Externalization by Chunks

Now our blog posts lives in

```{r, eval=FALSE}
website2/content/blog
```

and we have a project submodule here:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
website2/content/blog/git-blogdown-workflow
```

By default `knitr` assumes that the root directory is the one that the `.Rmd` lives in, so in this case `/blog`. However, we'd like our blog post to execute code that thinks its root is `/git-blogdown-workflow`. 

We can change this default behavior in the setup chunk of the `.Rmd` with `knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = ...)`^[If you build your own `public` folder to deploy at your website, point `knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = ...)` to wherever the local copy of your project's repo is.]. For example, here is the setup chunk I have in the beginning of this blog post:
````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, 
                      results='show', cache=FALSE, autodep=FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'git-blogdown-workflow/')
```
````
Note that I strongly recommend setting `cache` and `autodep` to false in the chunk options. In my experience, reading in external data can confuse the cache resulting in data existing where it shouldn't. And if you want to use the cache because the blog post is doing a lot of expensive calculations, I recommend moving that code into a project `.R` script that saves the results as `.RDS` files, which you can then read into your blog post.

Now that our `.Rmd` thinks it lives in the project directory `git-blogdown-workflow`, we can start using the project's files.

Here are the two most common procedures. First, to utilize external `.R` scripts within the blog post's `.Rmd` we need to use `knitr::read_chunk`. 

````
```{r}`r ''`
knitr::read_chunk(path = 'your_script.R')
```
````
This will initialize the script within the blog's `.Rmd` environment and allow us to call the code chunks.

In the `.R` script, code chunks will be delimited by this decoration:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## ---- chunk_name ----
```

To call that chunk within the `.Rmd` session of this blog, we need to do the following:

````
```{r chunk_name}`r ''`
```
````

That will execute the chunk within this session. The results will also be available to use within the blog's `.Rmd` environment. 

Let's work through an example.

### Example 1: The Basics

We'll start simple by working with the R script [`sim.R`](https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow/blob/master/sim.R).

Before we can call the chunks in our file, we need to initialize the `.R` script with `read_chunk`.^[You can include the chunk option `echo=FALSE` if you don't want to show `read_chunk` in your blog post. See [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for more details.] 

````
```{r}`r ''`
knitr::read_chunk(path = 'sim.R')
```
````
```{r}
knitr::read_chunk(path = 'sim.R')
```

This does not execute the code, but allows your blog post's `.Rmd` environment to utilize chunks from that `.R` script. 

After we've initialized the script with `read_chunk`, we can now call the code via the code externalization decorators we've added to the source code of `sim.R`. For example,

````
```{r simulate_function}`r ''`
```
````
which produces
```{r simulate_function}
```

This really helps with portability and maintainability. We haven't copied any code or scripts. The project script `sim.R` is being pull from the repo, so if the file is modified there, it will be modified here as well. 

And another useful feature is that calling `simulate_function` evalutes the code in the `.Rmd` environment of the blog post. So we can use the function within the post!

```{r}
monty_hall_sim('a', TRUE)
```

This is nice. We can now easily add simple, exploratory examples to the blog post  that we wouldn't want cluttering the `.R` script. 

Let's call the next chunk:
````
```{r run_simulation}`r ''`
```
````
```{r run_simulation}
```

Now we have the tibble `d` in our blog environment. For example, we can show
```{r}
head(d)
```

You do need to be careful with this data. Any future chunks you call from `sim.R` evaulate the code in the current environment. So if `d` were gone, the next chunk would fail:
```{r}
a <- d
d <- NULL
```

````
```{r plot_results}`r ''`
```
````
```{r plot_results, error = TRUE}
```

So you need to make sure you don't change the environmental variables in a way future chunks don't except. A good rule of thumb is to not change or make new variables within the blog environment. Only explore and view objects created from the chunks.

Let's fix our mistake and call the plot chunk again.

```{r}
d <- a
```

````
```{r plot_results}`r ''`
```
````
```{r plot_results, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
```

### Example 2: External Data

The last example was nice, but a little unrealistic. Usually we use R to work with external data.

Again, we'll do this by example. This time we want to showcase [`fit_model.R`](https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow/blob/master/fit_model.R). 
```{r}
knitr::read_chunk('fit_model.R')
```

This script fits a linear model to the `tidied_periodization.csv`^[We tidied this data set in a previous [blog post](https://timmastny.rbind.io/blog/tidying-messy-spreadsheets-dplyr/).] and plots the results.

Let's try the first chunk:
````
```{r read_data}`r ''`
```
````
```{r read_data}
```

Even though our blog post's `.Rmd` is actually in the directory above `tidied_periodization.csv`, we can read file as if the `.Rmd` was in the project's directory. This is because we called `knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'git-blogdown-workflow/')` in our setup chunk.

The next two chunks involve fitting and saving a linear model.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# copied from fit_model.R for reference
## ---- fit_model ----
m <- lm(post ~ pre, data = d)

## ---- save_fit ----
saveRDS(m, file = 'saved_model.rds')
```

Often we'd like to show how to fit the model, but we don't want to do the computation in the blog post. For me, writing a blog post is 90% rewriting and reorganizing and waiting to fit models is very disruptive, especially when working with machine learning algorithms or Bayesian packages such as [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) or [rstan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan) that take a very long time to fit.

There is a straightforward way to accomplish this. First we call the `fit_model` chunk without evaluating it, so we can show how to fit the model.
````
```{r fit_model, eval=FALSE}`r ''`
```
````
```{r fit_model, eval=FALSE}
```

Next, we load the model from the `.RDS` file within the project, with `echo=FALSE` so it doesn't disrupt the narrative of the post.

````
```{r, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
m <- readRDS('saved_model.rds')
```
````
```{r, echo=FALSE}
m <- readRDS('saved_model.rds')
```

And even though we haven't executed `fit_model.R` linearly, we can still execute the final chunk because we've read in the model:
````
```{r plot_model}`r ''`
```
````
```{r plot_model, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
```

## Conclusion

I think creating submodules of a project repo is a natural way to blog about a project in a way.

Thanks to [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/externalization/), `knitr` and`blogdown` are flexible enough to accomdate code externalization and changes to the working directory^[Changing the root/working directory in `knitr` has a long history. See [here](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/38) an early feature request and [here](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/277) for the creation of `root.dir`. And by no means am I first to notice the utility of this. Phil Mike Jones [blogged](https://philmikejones.wordpress.com/2015/05/20/set-root-directory-knitr/) in 2015 and there was a Stack Overflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30237310/setting-work-directory-in-knitr-using-opts-chunksetroot-dir-doesnt-wor) posted around the same time. All of these were very helpful when writing this post.]

The solution^[You could create a symbolic link between `website2/content` and `website2/content/git-blogdown-workflow` but I think that is an unneeded level of overhead. And creating those symbolic links varies between Linux and Windows.]
