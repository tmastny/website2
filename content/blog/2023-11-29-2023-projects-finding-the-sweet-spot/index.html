<p>I worked on numerous projects for the sake of learning and fun,
and I wanted to reflect on what made some of those projects
effective and others less so.</p>
<p>One realization I mentioned in my last post was specification:
Too perscriptive and I
feel like I’m copy/pasting code: too vague and I have no idea where to go
or how I’m doing.
And I realized this is relative to my own abilities: an underspecified
project to me might be overspecified and boring to someone else.
I say that because I’m going to talk about projects along this
dimensions and I don’t want to imply that these exercises/authors
are bad. In fact, they may be really good to some people,
but I want to show real examples so you can get a sense about what
I’m talking about. Ideally this will help you think about what
you want to get out of your next project before you commit to something.</p>
<p>Underspecified:
- Julia Evan’s <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/twitter-memes-challenge/">Challenge: find Twitter memes with suffix arrays</a>.</p>
<p>When I first came across this, this was intimidating along two factors:
1. I didn’t know go
2. the output was underspecified: what “counts” as a twitter meme?
Just common substrings? How do I know if I do it right?</p>
<p>Let’s contrast that with <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/">Distributed Services with Go</a>
- every line of code you need is written in the text book.
You can follow along and get exactly what you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html">Crafting Interpreters</a>
is a great example of the relative effect of specification.
Taking a look at the contents, like Distributed Services with Go,
it takes you through each line of code you need to write.
But for me, each line of code was very novel. Before this,
I’ve never implemented scanning, syntax trees, and virutal machines
so each line of code was highly novel: I had to think carefully
about how it all worked and went together and even push deeper
into the design, as I describe in my <a href="">garbage collection blog post</a>.
I also learned fun Java and C tricks I never encountered,
such as <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/strings.html">flexible array members</a>.</p>
