<p>I want to share what I’ve learned about CPU pipelining.
Thanks to Dan Luu’s branch <a href="https://danluu.com/branch-prediction/">prediction write-up</a>
I was vaguely aware how this worked conceptually,
but I was motivated to divide into the details after reading
Rodrigo Copetti’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#bibref:9">Playstation MIPS write-up</a>
where he talked about branch delay slots and how they evolved into
branch <em>prediction</em>. I quickly found many subtle and
fasincating details on CPU pipelining that I had to share.
For more details, I recommend
chapter 4 of Computer Organization and Design.</p>
<p>This post will assume you are familiar with the <a href="https://www.cybercomputing.co.uk/Languages/Hardware/laundryAnalogy.html">laundry</a>
or “assembly-line” model of CPU pipelining, but are hazy on some of the
lower-level details. It will also help to have a vague idea of
the 5-stage MIPS pipeline (<a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse410/05sp/lectures/cse410-10-pipelining-a.pdf">this</a>
is a nice, brief high-level summary), since our model CPU will be the 32-bit MIPS.</p>
<div id="visualizing-pipelines" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing Pipelines</h2>
<p>Let’s start by visualizing a basic CPU model that does not have pipelining
(aka a single-cycle CPU design):</p>
<div id="nonpipeline-container"></div>

<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const container = document.getElementById('nonpipeline-container');
  container.innerHTML = createPipelineHTML('nonpipelineViz');
  
  window.nonpipelineViz = new PipelineVisualization(
    document.getElementById('nonpipelineViz'),
    {
      instructions: [
        "add $t1",
        "sub $t2",
      ],
      sequence: [
        { pc: 0 },
        { pc: 1, if: "add $t1" },
        { pc: 1, id: "add $t1" },
        { pc: 1, ex: "add $t1" },
        { pc: 1, mem: "add $t1" },
        { pc: 1, wb: "add $t1" },
        { pc: 2, if: "sub $t2" },
        { pc: 2, id: "sub $t2" },
        { pc: 2, ex: "sub $t2" },
        { pc: 2, mem: "sub $t2" },
        { pc: 2, wb: "sub $t2" },
        { pc: null }
      ]
    }
  );
});
</script>
<p>One bottleneck is that only one component of the CPU is
active at a time: all others are inactive.</p>
<p>Pipelined CPUs fill in these vacancies by running instructions
through the stages one after the other, rather than waiting
for a single instruction to completely finish.</p>

<p>This seems pretty natural: it’s like an multiple person assembly line.
But there are already some subtle problems that need to be solved.</p>
</div>
<div id="instruction-decoding" class="section level2">
<h2>Instruction Decoding</h2>
<p>Instruction decoding orchestrates the entire pipeline
by providing fields used by the other stages.</p>
<p>Let’s work through an simplified example.
Say the instruction is</p>
<pre><code>add $t1, $s2, $s3</code></pre>
<p>The IF stage fetches the instruction and puts it into
the ID stage register. Now the ID register contains
fields that will be used by all the remaining stages.</p>
<pre><code>pc: 0x014b4820
-&gt; 
Field   op      rs      rt      rd      shamt   funct
Binary  000000  01010   01011   01001   00000   100000
#       add     $s2     $s3     $t1</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>EX will use <code>op</code>, <code>rs</code>, and <code>rt</code> for the ALU
operation and inputs</li>
<li>MEM (for <code>lw</code> and <code>sw</code>) uses <code>rt</code></li>
<li>WB will write to register <code>rd</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="id-dep.svg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>With pipelining, we have a problem.
For example, in cycle 3 in the previous visualization,
<code>add</code> moves into EX and <code>sub</code> moves into ID.
But WB needs to know the <code>rd</code> of the <code>add</code> instruction!
That field used to be safely stored in the ID register,
but <code>sub</code> overwrote it.</p>
<p>The solution is to have registers between each pipeline stage
that carry fields from the ID stage (as well as other stages).</p>
<p><img src="pipeline-registers.svg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Now when <code>add</code> reaches WB, it has the <code>rd</code> field so it
can write to the correct register. The actual value
from EX or MEM is also stored in the MEM/WB register as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="hazard-detection" class="section level2">
<h2>Hazard detection</h2>
<p>The field metadata from ID needs to be available at each stage
to enable basic operations like writing back to the registers,
but the fields also turn out to be crucial to solve data hazards.</p>
<p>To start, let’s look at this example:</p>
<div id="pipelineblocked-container"></div>

<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const container = document.getElementById('pipelineblocked-container');
  container.innerHTML = createPipelineHTML('pipelineblocked');
  
  window.pipelineblocked = new PipelineVisualization(
    document.getElementById('pipelineblocked'),
    {
      instructions: [
        "add r3, r1, r4",
        "sub r5, r3, r6"
      ],
      sequence: [
        { pc: 0 },
        { pc: 1, if: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: 2, if: "sub r5, r3, r6", id: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: null, id: "sub r5, r3, r6", ex: "add r3, r1, r4" },
      ]
    }
  );
});
</script>
<p><code>sub</code> has a dependency on the output of <code>add</code>: this is called a
data hazard. Structurally, the CPU could proceed but the result
would be incorrect. We need a way to check if any of the inputs
of the instruction in ID match the output register for any
downstream instructions.</p>
<p>Since the field metadata is propogated to each stage register,
we have all the data we need! What’s missing is a unit to calculate
this:</p>
<pre><code>ID/EXE.rs == EX/MEM.rd || ID/EXE.rt == EX/MEM.rd ||
ID/MEM.rs == MEM/WB.rd || ID/MEM.rt == MEM/WB.rd</code></pre>
<p>That’s the <em>Hazard Detection Unit</em> (HDU). This unit will
will both detect hazards
and prevent progress until the hazard is resolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This hazard detection logic works for “R-type” instructions
that write to registers (like <code>add</code> and <code>and</code>), but not every
instruction writes to registers (like <code>sw</code>). We’d technically
need to check a few other conditions for a complete implementation,
especially around data hazards involving <code>lw</code> and <code>sw</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="hdu.svg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The solid lines show the inputs to the HDU, detecting the hazard.
The dotted lines are the control signals, stopping the PC and IF
and writing a <code>nop</code> instruction to the ID/EX register.</p>
<p>The <code>nop</code> will proceed through each stage, eventually causing the
hazard comparison logic to be false. This will lift the stall
on the PC and IF stages, and remove the signal
allowing the <code>sub</code> instruction to continue.</p>
<div id="pipeline2-container"></div>

<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const container = document.getElementById('pipeline2-container');
  container.innerHTML = createPipelineHTML('pipelineViz2');
  
  window.pipelineViz2 = new PipelineVisualization(
    document.getElementById('pipelineViz2'),
    {
      instructions: [
        "add r3, r1, r4",
        "sub r5, r3, r6"
      ],
      sequence: [
        { pc: 0 },
        { pc: 1, if: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: 2, if: "sub r5, r3, r6", id: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: null, id: "sub r5, r3, r6", ex: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: null, id: "sub r5, r3, r6", mem: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: null, id: "sub r5, r3, r6", wb: "add r3, r1, r4" },
        { pc: null, ex: "sub r5, r3, r6" },
        { pc: null, mem: "sub r5, r3, r6" },
        { pc: null, wb: "sub r5, r3, r6" },
        { pc: null }
      ]
    }
  );
});
</script>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are stalls also called bubbles? Because once they appear
they flow through the pipeline until they pop out of the end.
Like a diver who let’s out some air underwater, the bubble
will rise to the surface. Stretching the analogy further,
the diver, like the HDU, can let out more than one bubble
depending on the circumstance. The previous example let out
2 bubbles.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="forwarding" class="section level2">
<h2>Forwarding</h2>
<p>There’s another way we can use the hazard detection logic
on the register metadata to resolve certain types of hazards.</p>
<p>Instead of stalling, we can “forward” an intermediate
result to the next instruction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: Even though the data is moving back in the pipeline,
it’s called forwarding because in a multi-clock pipelining
diagram the dependencies can be written “forward” in time.
See page 364 of Computer Organization and Design 4th Ed.
for more discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s continue with our <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> example.
The between-stage registers not only hold metadata, but they
also hold the results of the prior stage. If we detect
a hazard, we can immediately use that result instead of
waiting for the instruction to write back to the register and
exit the pipeline.</p>
<p><img src="fu.svg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The forwarding unit (FU) uses the same comparison logic and if
it detects a hazard the control sub-unit ensures the EX result
is used instead of the input register data (<code>r3</code> in this case).
For this particular case, the hazard resolves with zero stalls!
(see figure 4.60 in Computer Organization and Design
4th Ed. for the full picture, this is a bit of a simplification).</p>

        { pc: null } 
      ]
    }
  );
});
</script>
</div>
<div id="hdu-and-fu" class="section level2">
<h2>HDU and FU</h2>
<p>In the FU diagram, I did not add the comparison between the
ID/EX input registers and the MEM/WB output registers that
I had for the HDU.</p>
<p>The problem is that forwarding can’t handle this problem alone.
Let’s look at this example:</p>
<pre><code>lw  r1, 0(r2)  
add r3, r1, r4</code></pre>
<p>Our HDU handles this situation just fine: in fact, it’s identical
to the previous HDU example where the HDU must stall until
WB writes back to register <code>r1</code>, creating 2 bubbles.</p>
<p>But there’s an opportunity here:
the intermediate result is available in the MEM/WB register
before it’s written to r1 so we could forward to <code>add</code>’s EX stage.
To do this, the FU and HBU have to work in conjunction
to save 1 bubble.</p>
<div id="hdufupipeline-container"></div>

  window.hdufupipeline = new PipelineVisualization(
    document.getElementById('hdufupipeline'),
    {
      instructions: [
//lw  r1, 0(r2)  
//add r3, r1, r4
        "lw r1, 0(r2)",
        "add r3, r1, r4"
      ],
      sequence: [
        { pc: 0 },
        { pc: 1, if: "lw r1, 0(r2)" },
        { pc: 2, if: "add r3, r1, r4", id: "lw r1, 0(r2)" },
        { pc: null, id: "add r3, r1, r4", ex: "lw r1, 0(r2)" },
        { pc: null, id: "add r3, r1, r4", mem: "lw r1, 0(r2)" },
        { pc: null, ex: "add r3, r1, r4", wb: "lw r1, 0(r2)" },
        { pc: null, mem: "add r3, r1, r4" },

        { pc: null }
      ]
    }
  );
});
</script>
<p>I’m not going to go into all the details on how the HDU and FU
work together, because it’s a little bit different
than how I’ve laid it out here. And as I hinted at with this example,
there nuances around <code>lw</code> and <code>sw</code> instructions
you have to be careful with.</p>
</div>
<div id="branching" class="section level2">
<h2>Branching</h2>
<p>The tools we’ve built up so far (register metadata,
forwarding, and stalls) will help us tackle
branching aka control hazards.</p>
<p>We’ll start out with the simplest technique.</p>
<div id="predict-branch-not-taken" class="section level3">
<h3>Predict branch not taken</h3>
<p>The logic and implementation behind branch not taken
is very similar to forwarding to resolve data hazards.
With forwarding, the EX (or MEM) result of one instruction
is used as input to the EX stage of an upcoming instruction.</p>
<p>For branch prediction, the EX stage calculates the branch condition
and saves the result to the EX/MEM register. If the branch <strong>is</strong> taken,
we “forward” that fact to <em>all</em> previous stages.
This information is not used as an input, but rather converts
the instruction into a <code>nop</code> that will bubble through the pipeline.</p>
<p>Additionally, the branch target address was saved in the
inter-stage registers and is used to update the PC
(this is calculated from the branch offset instruction argument
and the branch’s PC during the ID stage in the Branch Target
Address Calculation (BTAC) unit. There is a diagram below showing
the flow).</p>

<h4>Branch delay slot</h4>
<p>A simple improvement to this scheme actually uses less hardware.
Instead of converting ID, IF, and EX into <code>nop</code> we assume that the
instruction immediately after the branch will execute no matter what.
The position immediately after the branch is called the <em>branch delay slot</em>
and the compiler or programmer is responsible for filling it.</p>
<p>The advantage is that instead of 3 bubbles, we only have 2.</p>
<p>Suppose we add an instruction prior to the branch in our last example.
The compiler may reorganize the instructions so <code>add</code> happens after
the branch in the branch delay slot.</p>
<pre><code>add t0, t1, t2  \   beq r1, r2, br
beq r1, r2, br  /   add t0, t1, t2
add r7, r1, r4      add r7, r1, r4
lw  r8, 0(t6)       lw  r8, 0(t6)</code></pre>
<p>Now the pipeline can still “predict” branch not taken,
but <code>add t0</code> will still execute and do useful work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes the compiler can’t find an instruction
to fill the branch delay slot and will have to
insert a <code>nop</code> anyway.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example, where we iterate over an array
until we find zero.</p>
<pre><code>loop:
    lw   t0, 0(s0)    
    beq  t0, 0, done 
    nop                 
    add  s0, s0, 4      
    j    loop           
done:</code></pre>
<p><code>add</code> can not go into the branch delay slot, because if the branch
was taken, we would have incorrectly modified <code>s0</code>. <code>s0</code> would no longer point to
the first zero in the array. And we can’t move <code>lw</code> down into the slot, because the branch depends
on the value of <code>t0</code>, so <code>lw</code> must execute first.</p>
<p>Now maybe a sufficiently intelligent compiler could figure out a solution
(maybe it’s okay to put <code>add</code> in the slot and as long as we later subtract 4 to get the
zero’s pointer), but these are the situations the compiler has to consider.</p>

<h3>Dynamic branch prediction</h3>
<p>In this section, I only want to briefly cover dynamic branch prediction resolution,
because Dan Luu’s <a href="https://danluu.com/branch-prediction/">write-up</a> covers
many details about the prediction itself (I recommend the section on 2-bit saturating
counters. His explanation really made things click for me).</p>
<p>Luckily, the resolution logic for dynamic branch is almost identical to
the resolution logic when we predict branch not taken.
In the simple branch prediction case, we compare the branch result of
the EX stage to our <em>assumption</em> that the branch was not taken.</p>
<p>For dynamic branch prediction resolution, we need to store the prediction
and compare it to the actual branch result in the EX/MEM register.
The means when we fetch the branch prediction in the IF stage, the prediction
must be stored in the IF/ID register and propagated to downstream
inter-stage registers.</p>
<p>I’m not including an iterative visualization here,
because it’s identical to the last one.
I do have a rough schematic of branch prediction and resolution
to show the high-level flow:</p>
<p><img src="dynamic-branch.svg" /><!-- --></p>
<ul>
<li>BRU (Branch Resolution Unit)
<ul>
<li>compares the actual branch result to the prediction</li>
<li>flushes the pipeline if the prediction was incorrect</li>
<li>writes to BPU to update the prediction (depending on the prediction scheme, it will
write to the unit whether the prediction is write or wrong)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BTAC (Branch Target Address Calculation)
<ul>
<li>calculates the branch target address from the branch’s PC and the branch offset,
which the BRU uses to update the PC on a misprediction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BPU (Branch Prediction Unit, aka Branch Target Buffer (BTB))
<ul>
<li>looks up the branch prediction based on last bits of branch PC and</li>
<li>writes prediction to IF/ID register</li>
<li>stores whether the branch was last taken or not</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I first got interested in CPU pipelining through high-level articles like Dan Luu’s
<a href="https://danluu.com/branch-prediction/">branch prediction write-up</a> and Rodrigo Copetti’s
<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#bibref:10">PlayStation architecture analysis</a>.
Conceptually, the ideas were fascinating, and they made me want to dive into the details to
see how everything worked.</p>
<p>I was most impressed by how the simple core mechanisms of register metadata, stalls, and forwarding
are continuously combined and remixed to solve increasingly complex problems.</p>
