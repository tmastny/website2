## funneljoin

In my previous [blog post](/blog/funnel-join), 
I explored the awesome [funneljoin](https://github.com/robinsones/funneljoin)
package. 
Check that post out for an overview of the package
and some examples.

In this post, 
I'm going to investigate business problems that can't be modeled with
gaps,
and how we can work around that.

## Gaps vs. deadlines

![](/blog/gaps-deadlines.png)

Gap

* if the next event must happen within a window of time, use gaps.

Example:

> if a customer clicks on an ad, 
and then purchases the product 30 days later
the company may not want to attribute that purchase to the ad.

Deadline

* if the next event must occur before a specific time, use deadlines.

Examples:

> Turbo Tax wants to know the conversion rate between
uploading your
W-2s and filing your taxes. 
But they only care if you file your taxes before April 15.

> A football coaches need to print off opponent reports 
before their upcoming game.


## How to model deadlines

In the last blog post, I showed how `funneljoin` supports gaps.
Let's figure out how we can model deadlines using `funneljoin`.

I'm going to start with the upload/submit/report logs again. 
Recall that the deadline to print is the same calendar week as the upload.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(funneljoin)
library(lubridate)

logs <- readRDS("funneljoin-logs.RDS")
logs
```

We want to separate the logs based on their deadline, 
which is the week of the upload. 
We can do that with `lubridate::floor_date` and
`tidyr::nest`.

```{r}
nested_events <- logs %>%
  mutate(deadline = floor_date(date, "week")) %>%
  nest(events = -deadline)

nested_events
```

This gives us a set of events for each deadline period.

Now, we want to apply the funnel and summary for the events 
in each deadline period. 
We'll use `purrr::map` to calculate the conversions for each set of events.

```{r}
customer_funnel <- function(.data) {
  .data %>% 
    funnel_start(
      moment_type = "upload",
      moment = "event",
      tstamp = "date",
      user = "user"
    ) %>%
    funnel_steps(
      moment_types = c("submit", "print"),
      type = "any-firstafter",
    )
}
```

```{r}
nested_events %>%
  mutate(conversions = map(
    events, 
    ~customer_funnel(.) %>%
      summarize_conversions(date_print)
  )) %>%
  unnest(conversions) %>%
  select(-events)
```

In this case, 
the conversion percentages are the same whether we use gaps or deadline.

However, this isn't real data. 
The simulated data I created doesn't cover every scenario.
With real data, we need to carefully think if we want gaps
or deadlines.

## What I'd like to see

As much as I love `funneljoin`, I think the 

> `nest -> funnel -> summarise -> unnest`

workflow is a little clunky. 

I think it would be cool if `funnel_start` respected a grouped data frame,
when looking for the next step in the funnel.

For example, we can pass a grouped data frame to `funnel_start`:

```{r}
logs %>%
  mutate(week = week(date)) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  funnel_start(
    moment_type = "upload",
    moment = "event",
    tstamp = "date",
    user = "user"
  ) %>%
  funnel_steps(
    moment_types = c("submit", "print"),
    type = "any-firstafter"
  ) %>%
  select(date_upload, date_print)
```

But `funneljoin` finds the `firstafter` print date outside of the week
of the upload (the group parameter for the data-frame).

I want to find the `firstafter` inside the week of the upload 
(the group parameter).

## Conclusion

Gaps or deadlines depend on the business we are trying to model.
While gaps are very easy to use with `funneljoin`, 
we can still analyze conversions 
in a deadline-based funnel
with a little extra work.
