What is Hugo? The magic behind blogdown





The goal isn’t to talk about the details of Hugo.
Both [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and
[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) have excellent
documentation on that front.
In this article, I’ll conceptually example hugo with diagrams.

Hugo makes it so you can focus on content.
We just need to fill in the “leaves” at the bottom of the tree:
the posts and projects.



One we do that, Hugo (and the Hugo theme) do all the work of making the website.

This post will explain what that work actually is.
We’ll attempt to explain the Hugo magic that powers blogdown and other websites
that make it easy to create websites, without knowing web development.

Why learn about Hugo? If you’ve ever wanted to customize your website,
it will help to understand what Hugo does and how it can help you.
Ideally, you’ll feel more confident making changes,
and maybe take a stab at customizing your theme.

To begin, we need to understand what a website is.
These days, websites can be incredibly complicated,
so let’s look at a model of a website you might use for a blog:



Let’s call this model the *simple tree website*.
Your home page links to your blog page.
And your blog page links to your blog posts.
You can see how this makes a tree.

Remember: Hugo enables us to focus on the *posts* and ignore everything else.
So let’s focus there.

When we write a blogpost with Hugo, we focus on the content.
What are the words and images our readers will see.
But there are components to a webpage (pic). We typically have a navigation bar,
and a footer (potentially with comments). This creates a sandwich.

What Hugo does for us is make that sandwich.
We write the content, and Hugo glues the header and footer.
The headers and footers, by web-design convent,
also content useful things like styles and extra JavaScript.

Hugo is the master chef, putting buns on the protein and cheese we made.
But let’s refer back to our model of websites.
Posts (and projects) are only one type of web page.
We also have Home pages, project pages,
and places to scroll through our blog posts.
Conceptually, these pages are all **lists** of content below them.

A good Home Page will link to your blog and projects pages.
And your blog page will need to list all your articles so readers can scroll
through them to read and discover. Fundamentally, they are all lists.

Lucky for us, Hugo is a master chef.
Not only can they put buns on our burger, but they can also add the cheese.
So when necessary, Hugo glues on the header and footer,
and adds lists describing content below the tree.
