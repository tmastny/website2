<p>As we saw in the previous post, we need a way to evaluate
branch prediction algorithms empirically: in real world programs,
how accurate are the predictions?
There are well-know benchmarks and advanced CPU tools to track
branch predictions, but I wanted to approach this problem
with a hacker mentality: how can I use the tools I have
in creative ways to investigate this for myself?</p>
<p>My goal is to share some of the details around:
* disassembling executables
* handling binary executables and shared libraries
* exploring the LLDB API and dealing with bugs</p>
<p>If you are interested in LLDB, debugging, and implementations
challenges, this article is for you.
The full code is available on <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/gshare/tree/main/extract_branch_data">Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you want the results
and visualizations

<div id="disassembling-executables" class="section level2">
<h2>Disassembling executables</h2>
<p>The easiest approach is <code>otool</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>otool -tv /usr/local/bin/tree</code></pre>
<p>This gives the disassembly of the entire program.</p>
<p>You can also disassemble with LLDB, but it’s more complicated.
By default, LLDB only disassembles a single function or frame
rather than the entire program, even if you know the instruction
address range.
<code>otool</code> disassembles everything, so I didn’t spend any more time
trying to figure out how to do it with LLDB.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of a branch instruction we’ll be parsing
from the assembly:</p>
<pre class="asm"><code>0000000100007f03	movq	(%rbx), %rdi
0000000100007f06	testq	%rdi, %rdi
0000000100007f09	je	0x100008281</code></pre>
<div id="linked-libraries" class="section level3">
<h3>Linked Libraries</h3>
<p>The binary executable is just a portion of the total branches of the problem.
An executable may also rely on shared libraries: code that is compiled and lives
on the operating system. Most commonly these are things in the standard C
such as memory allocation and file I/O.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>% otool -L /usr/local/bin/tree

/usr/local/bin/tree:
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1319.100.3)</code></pre>
<p>We get a fuller story with LLDB:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>(lldb) target modules list
[  0] 73B8A897-9703-340B-9105-3DA7C54F7231 0x0000000100000000 /usr/local/bin/tree
[  1] BE14380C-5E18-3640-9FBE-851BEB014BBA 0x00007ff800098000 /usr/lib/dyld
[  2] F2CA671C-5D32-3BBF-BCAD-CF23124D69F6 0x00007ff80c26e000 /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
[  3] FA6C4BA7-091E-3F12-BFE1-E51040E31C66 0x00007ff80c268000 /usr/lib/system/libcache.dylib
...</code></pre>
<p>The dynamic linker <code>/usr/lib/dyld</code> itself must be loaded into memory to manage the
shared libraries <code>tree</code> needs. And <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code> is better thought of as a
collection of smaller libraries that might need to be loaded.</p>
<p>The compiler stores all this information in the <code>tree</code> binary itself,
in the <code>load commands</code> section.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>DYLD_PRINT_BINDINGS=1 /usr/local/bin/tree .
(lldb) breakpoint set -f libsystem_platform.dylib -p &quot;je|jne|jg|jl&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="parsing-instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Parsing instructions</h2>
<p>To parse the disassembly, we need to search for and save the address of
all conditional branch instructions.</p>
<p>This will depend on your CPU architecture.
I did this on my 2020 MacBook Air with Intel Ice Lake, which is x86-64.
If you want to run this analysis for yourself on a modern ARM MacBook,
you’ll have to both filter for different instructions and
tracing with LLDB will be different as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="tracing-with-lldb" class="section level2">
<h2>Tracing with LLDB</h2>
<p>Next, we need to run LLDB on the executable, set breakpoints on all branch
addresses, and log the branch history.</p>
<p>I quickly discovered running LLDB on certain executables are off limits: Apple really
doesn’t like you attaching a debugger even to something simple like the <code>ls</code> command
in <code>/bin/ls</code>. I tinkered with SIP and csrutils, but couldn’t get anything to work.
If there’s a way around this let me know!
I ended up using <code>tree</code> and <code>bzip2</code> as my test executables, installed with Homebrew.</p>
<p>Typically, you use LLDB on a binary compiled with debugging symbols,
which let you set breakpoints on function names or line numbers.
Even without debugging symbols, compiled binaries have externally available
symbols like function names.
For example, <code>tree</code> has <code>main</code> and
<code>emit_tree</code> symbols.</p>
<p>However, we need to break on addresses.</p>
<div id="address-based-breakpoints" class="section level3">
<h3>Address-based breakpoints</h3>
<p>This is a typical branch instruction from the disassembled binary:</p>
<pre class="asm"><code>0000000100007f09	je	0x100008281</code></pre>
<p><code>0x100007f09</code> is where we want LLDB to break so we can trace the branch history.
Just like we can set a breakpoint on a function name, we can set one
directly on an address.</p>
<pre><code>(lldb) target create /usr/local/bin/tree

(lldb) breakpoint set --name main
(lldb) breakpoint set -a 0x100007f09

(lldb) breakpoint list
Current breakpoints:
1: name = &#39;main&#39;, locations = 1
  1.1: where = tree`main, address = tree[0x0000000100004e08], unresolved, hit count = 0

2: address = 0x0000000100007f09, locations = 1
  2.1: address = 0x0000000100007f09, unresolved, hit count = 0</code></pre>
<p>At this point, both breakpoints are <em>unresolved</em>.
An unresolved breakpoint means LLDB knows where we want to break in theory,
but doesn’t yet know where that instruction will actually be located when the program runs.</p>
<p>We call the address written in the binary file (0x100007f09) the <em>file address</em>,
and the address where the instruction is loaded into memory the <em>load address</em>.
There are a few reasons why file and load addresses might differ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) randomly offsets memory addresses for security</li>
<li>shared libraries often have overlapping file addresses that need to be relocated when loaded</li>
</ul>
<p>When we run <code>target create /usr/local/bin/tree</code>, the program isn’t yet loaded:
rather LLDB gathers all the object and symbol files (called modules or images)
associated with the executable, so we can set breakpoints before the program is running.
Only when we run <code>process launch --stop-at-entry</code> or <code>run</code> is the program
loaded into memory, the load addresses are set, and the breakpoints are resolved.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the symbol table looking at the <code>emit_tree</code> in <code>tree</code>
and <code>memcpy</code> in the dynamic linker <code>dyld</code>:</p>
<pre><code># target modules dump symtab tree [/usr/lib/dyld]
Index   UserID DSX Type            File Address/Value Load Address        Name
------- ------ --- --------------- ------------------ ------------------  ---------
[   67]     67   X Code            0x0000000100007ec7                     emit_tree
[   87]     87     Code            0x00007ff80009a140                     memcpy

# after `(lldb) process launch --stop-at-entry`
[   67]     67   X Code            0x0000000100007ec7 0x0000000100007ec7  emit_tree
[   87]     87     Code            0x00007ff80009a140 0x000000010001e140  memcpy</code></pre>
<p>For the main executable, the file address and load address are the same.
LLDB by default asks the operating system
to disable ASLR. But even with ASLR disabled, shared libraries may have different
file and load addresses, so LLDB does not resolve breakpoints until the program is loaded.</p>
<p>Now we’ve set the stage for <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D109738">bug 38317</a>.
If we set the file address breakpoint before the program is loaded, and <code>run</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(lldb) run
...
(lldb) breakpoint list
Current breakpoints:
1: name = &#39;main&#39;, locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 1
  1.1: where = tree`main, address = 0x0000000100004e08, resolved, hit count = 1

2: address = 0x0000000100007f09, locations = 1
  2.1: address = 0x0000000100007f09, unresolved, hit count = 0</code></pre>
<p>the breakpiont at 0x100007f09 remains unresolved, even though the program is loaded
and the file and load address are the same! An unresolved breakpoint
will <em>not</em> trigger when the program is running.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we set the breakpoint after the program is loaded
the breakpoint is immediately resolved.</p>
<pre><code>(lldb) breakpoint set -a 0x100007f09
Breakpoint 2: where = tree`emit_tree + 66, address = 0x0000000100007f09
(lldb) breakpoint list
...
2: address = tree[0x0000000100007f09], locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 0
  2.1: where = tree`emit_tree + 66, address = 0x0000000100007f09, resolved, hit count = 0</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can set the breakpoint with the <code>-s</code> flag to tell LLDB
to resolve the address to the file. Then as with the main breakpoint,
the breakpoint will resolve after the process is launched.</p>
<pre><code>(lldb) breakpoint set -a 0x100007f09 -s tree
...
1: address = tree[0x0000000100007f09], locations = 1
  1.1: where = tree`emit_tree + 66, address = tree[0x0000000100007f09], unresolved, hit count = 0

(lldb) process launch --stop-at-entry
...
1: address = tree[0x0000000100007f09], locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 0
  1.1: where = tree`emit_tree + 66, address = 0x0000000100007f09, resolved, hit count = 0</code></pre>
<p>Nothing we can’t work around, but I think it’s interesting to see how LLDB
works a bit under-the-hood and how are tools often have some small bugs when
we take a small step off the beaten path.</p>
</div>
<div id="scripting-lldb" class="section level3">
<h3>Scripting LLDB</h3>
<p>LLDB has two nice scripting interfaces: the Python module and LLDB commands.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with the interactive LLDB shell, LLDB commands are the
easiest way to start. All you need to do is to add the commands you would run
interactively to a file and execute:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># commands.lldb
target create /usr/local/bin/tree
breakpoint set --name main
run
breakpoint set --address 0x100007f09
breakpoint command add -o &#39;register read rflags&#39; -o &#39;continue&#39;
continue
# run the script
lldb -s commands.lldb # with -o to run the script and exit</code></pre>
<p>Python is also an option.
You’ll either need to make sure that you are using the same
Python as LLDB, or you’ll need to set the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
to the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/python-reference.html#using-the-lldb-py-module-in-python">LLDB Python module.</a></p>
<pre class="python"><code># commands.py
import lldb

def run_commands(debugger, command=None, result=None, internal_dict=None):
    target = debugger.CreateTarget(&quot;/usr/local/bin/tree&quot;)
    main_bp = target.BreakpointCreateByName(&quot;main&quot;)
    process = target.LaunchSimple(None, None, None)
    addr_bp = target.BreakpointCreateByAddress(0x100007f09)

    commands = lldb.SBStringList()
    commands.AppendString(&quot;register read rflags&quot;)
    commands.AppendString(&quot;process continue&quot;)
    addr_bp.SetCommandLineCommands(commands)

    process.Continue()</code></pre>
<pre class="bash"><code>lldb -o &quot;script import commands; commands.run_commands(lldb.debugger)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, there’s the C++ API. The Python API is just a thin wrapper around the C++ API,
so once you are comfortable there it’s not hard to move to C++.
You need to install <code>llvm</code> to get access to the library and headers.</p>
<p>However, don’t expect much of a performance boost. I implemented branch tracing
with all three methods and performance was about the same for a trace with
with about 1000 branches about 20,000 branch predictions:</p>
<pre><code>./branch_data_cpp.py  83.095 ± 0.452 seconds
./branch_data_py.py   95.014 ± 0.460 seconds
./branch_data_lldb.py 98.909 ± 0.271 seconds</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="instruction-stepping" class="section level3">
<h3>Instruction stepping</h3>
<p>One way to depend a little less on the instruction set
would be to step through the branch instruction and see
where you end up. This was a my first attempt,
but I ran into another bug.</p>
<p>As you saw in the last section, the basic plan is to
set a breakpoint on each branch instruction, and then set a
breakpoint command to log the data.
When looking at the instruction set, we saw that we can
figure out the branch behavior by looking at the flags register,
which we configured LLDB to log:</p>
<pre><code>breakpoint command add -o &#39;read register rflags&#39; -o &#39;continue&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If we didn’t want to parse rflags, another approach might be
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>breakpoint command add -o &#39;step instruction&#39; -o &#39;p\x $pc&#39; -o &#39;continue&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This works great running interactively in LLDB,
I couldn’t get it to work in an automated script, with
LLDB commands or in Python.</p>
