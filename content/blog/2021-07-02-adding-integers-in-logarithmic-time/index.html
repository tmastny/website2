<h2>Elementary School Addition Algorithm</h2>
<p>The elementary school addition algorithm works for binary numbers
<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>  1 1 1 1 1    (carried digits)
    0 1 1 0 1
+   1 0 1 1 1
-------------
= 1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36</code></pre>
<p>It works in binary (or any base) because the sum of any
3 single-digit numbers is at most two digits.</p>
<p>The time complexity is <code>O(n)</code>: we need to result of the previous
iteration before we can correctly compute the
sum of the current iteration<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="hardware-complexity" class="section level2">
<h2>Hardware Complexity</h2>
<p>In certain software-based model of computation, adding can never
be faster than <code>O(n)</code> because we need to read each pair of bits
sequentially.
Hardware provides an alternative model with natural parallelism.</p>
<p>The value of each bit in an <code>n</code>-bit number is stored on a wire.
Wires connect to circuits gates which transform the input to
zero or one. All wires are transformed simultaneously,
not one at a time.</p>
<p>For example, let’s compute the bitwise <code>AND</code> of two <code>n</code>-bit numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
by connecting their bit-wires to an <code>AND</code> gate:</p>
<p><img src="bitwise-and.JPG" /></p>
<p>To calculate the time complexity of this operation, we look at the
height of the circuit diagram. In this case, the height is
independent of <code>n</code>, the number of bits.
Therefore, bit-wise <code>AND</code> can be calculated in <code>O(1)</code> constant time.</p>
<p>The trade-off is the space complexity, analogous to memory complexity
in the software model. The space complexity is proportional to the
number of gates used. We need an <code>AND</code> gate for each bit, so
the space complexity is <code>O(n)</code>.</p>
<div id="elementary-school-adder" class="section level3">
<h3>Elementary School Adder</h3>
<p>If we implement the elementary school adder in hardware,
the time complexity is still <code>O(n)</code>. The parallelism doesn’t
help, because each circuit has to the wait for the previous
carry digit:</p>
<p><img src="circuit-adder.JPG" /></p>
<p>You can also think about it in terms of height like the last
example, where the top is the first bits <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>
and the bottom is <span class="math inline">\(s_3\)</span>. The height grows at <code>O(n)</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="carry-lookahead-adder" class="section level2">
<h2>Carry-lookahead Adder</h2>
<p>We can improve the algorithm by looking at the states that produce a carry.
If <code>a AND b</code>, then there will be a carry. If <code>a OR b</code> <em>and</em> there is a carry from
the last iteration, then there will be a new carry. These are called
generating and propagating carries respectively. We can summarize this
with symbols as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
c_{i + 1} &amp;= a_i b_i + (a_i + b_i) c_i \\
c_{i + 1} &amp;= g_i + p_i c_i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s work out the 4-bit carries:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
c_{1} &amp;= g_0 + p_0 c_0 \\
c_{2} &amp;= g_1 + p_1 c_1 \\
c_{3} &amp;= g_2 + p_2 c_2 \\
c_{4} &amp;= g_3 + p_3 c_3 \\
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>At first, this doesn’t seem like an improvement, because each
carry depends on the previous carry. But let’s substitute
carries into <span class="math inline">\(c_4\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
c_{4} &amp;= g_3 + p_3(g_2 + p_2 (g_1 + p_1 (g_0 + p_0 c_0))) \\
c_{4} &amp;= g_3 + p_3g_2 + p_3 p_2 g_1 + p_3 p_2 p_1 g_0 + p_3 p_2 p_1 p_0 c_0
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>The dominating term is <span class="math inline">\(p_3 p_2 p_1 p_0 c_0\)</span>,
with length proportional to <code>n</code>. Calculating this with
successive <code>AND</code> operations is still <code>O(n)</code>. But we can
divide-and-conquer to calculate this in <code>O(log n)</code>. For example:</p>
<p><img src="binary-and.JPG" /></p>
<p>Recall that the height of the circuit is the time complexity.
This circuit forms a binary tree (upside down),
which is known to have height <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(p_3 p_2 p_1 p_0 c_0\)</span> is the dominating term, the time complexity
of that operation is the time complexity of adding all the bits.
So the time complexity of adding two numbers is <code>O(log n)</code>!</p>
<div id="space-complexity" class="section level3">
<h3>Space Complexity</h3>
<p>The height a binary tree is <code>O(log n)</code> and the number of nodes
(the number of <code>AND</code> gates) is <code>O(2^n)</code>.</p>
<p>This is very expensive in terms of hardware. Each <code>AND</code> gate costs
money and takes physical space on a circuit board.
This algorithm is not feasible for even relatively small <code>n</code>.</p>

<div id="real-world-implementation" class="section level2">
<h2>Real-world Implementation</h2>
<p>Because of the cost and physical space, carry-lookahead adders
are not implemented for standard 32-bit integers.</p>
<p>The standard algorithm would require gates proportion to 32, while
carry-lookahead would require 2^32 = 4,294,967,296.</p>
<p>Instead, carry-lookahead adders are implemented using 4-bit sections
and chained together. The time complexity is still <code>O(n)</code>,
but with a constant factor speedup.</p>
