## Introduction

If you find yourself doing data analysis in Python, you should check out 
[siuba](https://github.com/machow/siuba). 
siuba is a port of the R package [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr),
but you don't need to know any R to get started.

siuba implements a domain specific language for querying data. You can use siuba
to query both local Python data frames and remote 
[SQL](https://github.com/machow/siuba#using-with-a-sql-database) databases.

Why a new "language" and not the pandas API?

1. concise lambdas and tab-completion

2. consistent output for common operations

3. unified API for grouped and ungrouped data frames



All of these advantages and more are described by Michael Chow in his list of
[key features](https://siuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key_features.html).

Let's walk through each case with some [example data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-27).


```{python}
from siuba import *
from siuba.data import mtcars

import pandas as pd
bridges = pd.read_csv("maryland_bridges.csv")
```

## Concise lambdas with tab-complete

siuba introduces the symbol `_`. You can think of `_` as a placeholder or pronoun
for the actual name of the data. 
So instead of writing `bridges.yr_built` you can write `_.yr_built` in any
data frame or siuba function.

In many ways, `_` behaves like a concise `lambda`:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
```{python}
bridges[_.yr_built > 1990]
```
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
```{python}
bridges[lambda _: _.yr_built > 1990]
```
</div>
</div>

And this new "lambda" doesn't just save a few characters: 
it also supports tab-completion in IPython and Jupyter Notebooks,
suggesting column names and pandas data frame and series methods:

This was my [small contribution](/blog/siuba-and-ipython-tab-complete) to Siuba, 
with lots of help from Michael Chow. Include the following to try it out!

```python
import siuba.experimental.completer
```


## Consistent output for common operations

Calculating the size of groups is a very common operation. 
siuba makes this, and many other queries straightforward by providing
[helpers](https://siuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_index.html) like
`count` and `distinct` and by
simplifying the API to [5 common actions](https://github.com/machow/siuba#siuba).

Additionally, siuba output is always *consistent*. siuba never returns 
[MultiIndex](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.MultiIndex.html)
data frames, which has its own API and idiosyncrasies. 


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
```{python, results='show'}
(bridges >>
    count(decade=10 * (_.yr_built // 10), sort=True) >>
    head())
```
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
```{python, results='show'}
(
  bridges
  .assign(decade=lambda _: 10 * (_.yr_built // 10))
  .groupby("decade")
  .agg(n = ("decade", "size"))
  .reset_index()
  .sort_values("n", ascending=False)
  .head()
)
```
</div>
</div>

## Unified group API

When working with groups in pandas, you often have to juggle both the grouped
and ungrouped data frame. Additionally, panda's grouped API has some subtle 
differences, such as the `transform` method shown below.

All of siuba's [core actions](https://siuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_index.html#module-siuba.dply.verbs)
have consistent behavior in grouped and ungrouped data frames.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
```{python}
(mtcars >>
    group_by(_.cyl) >>
    mutate(hp=_.hp - _.hp.mean()) >>
    ungroup())
```
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
```{python}
mtcars_cyl = mtcars.groupby("cyl")
(
  mtcars
  .assign(hp=mtcars_cyl.obj.hp - mtcars_cyl.hp.transform("mean"))
)
```
</div>
</div>
