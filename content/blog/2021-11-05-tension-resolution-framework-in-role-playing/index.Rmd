*How game mechanics create and resolve tension*
*How to create and resolve tension in role-playing games*

## Introduction




Here's how my role-playing games work.
I design a world with a set of challenges.
A player role-plays a character and uses the character's skills and abilities
to solve challenges in that world. A role-playing system determines if and how the challenge was resolved.



## Encounter Model

*Circumstance, Decision, Outcome* is a three-stage encounter model.

The circumstance is the situation described to the player.
For example:
> The guards walk into the shop and see you with the jewels.

The decision is the choice the player makes in that moment.
> I attempt to jump through the window and flee.

The outcome is what happens after the decision. It is the new circumstance.
> You jump through the open window and land gracefully in front of a squard of guards.

Although each stage effects tension, circumstance and outcome control the degree of tension.
Confronting the villian to save the world is more tense
than sneaking past a guard to steal gold.

## Decision Tension

If the narrative sets the tension in the circumstance, then player choice
amplifies tension in the decision. The rules govern what choices a player may make.
Each choice comes with risks and costs that create tension.

Risk is inherent to decision making, but the rules also influence risk.
Dice rolls cause risk by adding a random chance of failure.
I love the tension when a player has to make a roll or the party will die.
Game complexity also creates risk. Even in games without chance like chess,
there choices have risk. Rather than an random chance the failure, the risk
is that you made a mistake analyzing the game.

Where the rules fall on the spectrum random to determined also influence risk.
Purely random decisions can still be tense--think of the russian roulette.
The tension comes from being out of control. But if the


Risk is the chance that your decision will produce a poor outcome. Dice rolls
add a random chance of failure. I love the tension when you have to roll a 20 to
kill the boss or the party will die. There is also the risk of mistake, especially
common

There is no chance in chess, but there is a risk that you overlooked a response from your opponent.


Costs are consumed by your decision. Every decision has an [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).
But the decision may also spend resources such as spell slots, items, or charges.
Cost is a fun, because it makes the player decide if



Players worry about mistakes when the number of possible outcomes is large like a game of chess,
or when they many options like choosing a spell for a wizard in DnD.
The higher the stakes, the more risk creates tension.

Cost creates a different kind of tension. Spending resources resolves this encounter, but raises tension in future ones.

Role-playing systems are rules used to





I design campaigns so players can solve challenges with their skills.

As a Dungeon Master (DM), I want characters to solve challenges with their personality and skills.
I design campaigns with this in mind.



## Introduction

In this article, I propose a tension-resolution framework for role-playing games.
Furthermore, I will show that we can use the framework to improve mechanics for
investigative role-playing.

## Investigative Role-Playing

Here's how I like to run investigative role-playing games. I begin with a hook or premise.
The players create a character movitated to investigate the hook.
I populate the world with clues. And the *players* decipher the
clues to unravel the mysteries.

The characters collect the clues, but the players have to connect the dots.
Similar to deduction games like [Sherlock Holms Consultin Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder).
Players can't roll to make me to explain the clues for them. So I ensure the clues
are internally consistent, lead to a conclusion, *and* that the players can figure it out.
To read how this works in practice, check out this [Shut Up & Sit Down](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/rpg-review-trail-of-cthulhu/)
article. For Dungeon Masters, Justin Alexander wrote the
[definitive theory](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach)
on running investigations.

Finally, I include a role-playing system used to resolve conflicts and provide constraints.
In this article, I'll show why I think [Gumshoe](https://pelgranepress.com/2018/02/14/gumshoe/) systems
like [Trail of Cthulhu](https://pelgranepress.com/product/trail-of-cthulhu/) are best.

I'm want to use a system that maximizes tension and minimizing complexity.



## Tension-Resolution Framework







Investigative role-playing is a combination of two genres.
Deduction games, such as ,
and mechanical dice-based role-playing systems such as [D&D 5e](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex).

Deduction elements provide mystery, logical puzzles, and a sense of progress by collecting clues.
The role-playing systems offer gaming mechanics such as random chance, resource management, and abilities
These mechanics resolve conflict and provide role-playing constraints.

My campaign, [The Curse on Moonlight Bay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MvkKUkErnCAqWb7d8IaEQ8uJMS_XocKlCmDPT_sZzE/edit?usp=sharing),
is a good example about what I am trying to achieve with an investigative role-playing system.

Each campaign starts with a hook or premise. In The Curse on Moonlight Bay, there are 3:
- an exocrist has gone missing
- prohibition gangsters are smuggling liquor
- the hospital claims they have a cure for mass hysteria

The players create a character movitated to investigate the hook.
I populate the world with internally consistent clues. And the *players* decipher the
clues to unravel the mysteries.

> Sidebar: the characters collect the clues, but the players have to connect the dots.
Players can't roll to make me to explain the clues for them. So the Dungeon Master
has to put in a lot of work ahead of time to sure the players can solve the mystery.

Gaming mechanics





For the deduction to be rewarding, the clues must be internally consistent and lead to a logical conclusion.



Mechnical elements need to be simplified enough that the don't overwhelm and render
the deduction elements useless.
