<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm excited to announce my
<a href="https://github.com/tmastny/sagemaker">sagemaker R package</a>!</p>
<p>AWS Sagemaker is a powerful tool,
and I hope my package makes it easier for people to try it out!</p>
<p>Since the Github page and <a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/">website</a>
already introduce the sagemaker R package,
I want to use this blog post to introduce AWS Sagemaker,
productionizing machine learning, and how the my sagemaker R package
tries to make it all easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="aws-sagemaker" class="section level2">
<h2>AWS Sagemaker</h2>
<p>AWS Sagemaker is a platform for training machine learning models.</p>
<p>There are three components of Sagemaker:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>hosted development environment with juypter notebooks</li>
<li>scalable training of machine learning models</li>
<li>endpoint and batch predictions from trained models</li>
</ol>
<p>Hosted juypter notebooks are a great feature,
but this post will focus on Sagemaker‚Äôs scalable training and predictions.</p>
<div id="aws-cost" class="section level3">
<h3>AWS cost</h3>
<p>Before you use Sagemaker you need an AWS account.
AWS requires your credit card information so they can charge you for use
of services.</p>
<p>However, by taking advantage of free tier services
and closely monitoring usage, it‚Äôs possible to keep costs low.</p>
<p>Here is my Spend Summary for the entire time I developed the R package:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Spend: $4.05
<ul>
<li>By service:
<ul>
<li>Sagemaker: $4.05</li>
<li>Other services: $0.00</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free Tier Usage
<ul>
<li>S3 Put: 28%</li>
<li>S3 Get: 4.2%</li>
<li>Others: &lt;1%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>So if you are interested in learning AWS,
but aren‚Äôt in an enterprise environment,
it is definitely possible to get started.</p>

<div id="productionizing-machine-learning-predictions" class="section level2">
<h2>Productionizing machine learning predictions</h2>
<p>Before we dive into AWS Sagemaker,
let me introduce my mental model for generating machine learning
predictions:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/predictions-pipeline.svg" /></p>
<p>The workflow on the bottom is similar to the data exploration workflow shown in
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html">R for Data Science</a>.
We process data, evaluate, and select a model to deploy.</p>
<p>On the top, the key to repeatable, scheduled predictions is the
<em>predictions pipeline environment</em>.
A mature environment might be a docker image ran by AWS Batch,
scheduled by a CRON trigger on Jenkins.
A simple one would be an Rscript ran once a day on your desktop.</p>
<p>Think of the pipeline like a function, deployed on a certain trigger:</p>
<pre><code>## üïê 
## &lt;clock for 13:00 (~one o‚Äôclock) &gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>pipeline &lt;- function(...) {
  data &lt;- fetch_data(...) %&gt;%
    transform(...)
  
  model &lt;- sagemaker::sagemaker_attach_tuner(...)
  predict(model, data)
}</code></pre>
<p>One key feature of the environment is that processes are shared
with the training workflow.</p>
<p>For example, any data transformation or feature engineering process
must be shared between the training workflow and the predictions pipeline.
Otherwise, your predictions will not be reliable,
and your model might not even run against the new data if its a different shape.</p>
<p>Likewise, the pipeline needs to use the model we selected during training.</p>
</div>
<div id="sagemaker-features" class="section level2">
<h2>Sagemaker Features</h2>
<div id="training-and-evaluation" class="section level3">
<h3>Training and Evaluation</h3>
<p>For the training half of the productionization framework,
Sagemaker provides tools for scalable training of machine learning models.</p>
<p>You can choose the compute power and parallel model building
suitable for the scale of your training task.</p>
<p>In the R package, this is done by</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/sagemaker_estimator.html"><code>sagemaker::sagemaker_estimator</code></a><br />
<a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/sagemaker_hyperparameter_tuner.html"><code>sagemaker::sagemaker_hyperparameter_tuner</code></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also features for hyperparameter tuning,
as well as basic ways to evaluate tuning and model fit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/sagemaker_tuning_job_logs.html"><code>sagemaker::sagemaker_tuning_job_logs</code></a><br />
<a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/sagemaker_training_job_logs.html"><code>sagemaker::sagemaker_training_job_logs</code></a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="deployment" class="section level3">
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>In the <em>predictions pipeline environment</em>,
Sagemaker can also provide a scalable model to service predictions.</p>
<p>Sagemaker offers two different services,
depending on the requirements of the predictions.
Real-time endpoint and batch predictions:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/sagemaker-predict.svg" /></p>
<div id="real-time-endpoint" class="section level4">
<h4>Real-time endpoint</h4>
<p>First, the Sagemaker real-time predictions endpoint.
This operates on a request-response model,
where <em>transformed</em> data is sent and predictions are received.</p>
<p>The endpoint is scalable both in terms of
compute speed and parallel servicing, depending on the expected demand.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the environment (or the application)
is still responsible for transforming
the data as required by the model.
Sagemaker does not take care of this.</p>
<p>In the sagemaker R package,
real-time predictions managed by the
<a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/predict.sagemaker.html"><code>predict.sagemaker</code></a>
S3 method after the endpoint is deployed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/sagemaker_deploy_endpoint.html"><code>sagemaker::sagemaker_deploy_endpoint</code></a><code>(model)</code><br />
<code>predict(model, data)</code></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="batch-predictions" class="section level4">
<h4>Batch predictions</h4>
<p>Sagemaker also offers batch predictions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, making predictions on data in S3
and writing the predictions to S3.</p>
<p>As in the previous example,
the data in S3 should already be transformed as required by the model.</p>
<p>Additionally, the predictions pipeline needs to have permission and access
to Sagemaker to spin up resources.
And the predictions can‚Äôt be time sensitive, since you need to wait
for the compute resources to deploy.</p>
<p>In the sagemaker R package,
this process is executed by</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tmastny.github.io/sagemaker/reference/batch_predict.html"><code>sagemaker::batch_predict</code></a></p>

<div id="what-sagemaker-isnt" class="section level2">
<h2>What Sagemaker isn‚Äôt</h2>
<p>Sagemaker is not a full end-to-end solution for productionizing
machine learning predictions.
Ultimately, Sagemaker will only act as an API service to generate
predictions.</p>
<p>That means you‚Äôll need to find other services to build and maintain the
entire <em>predictions pipeline environment</em>.
This is a complex system, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the environment itself, usually a docker image</li>
<li>scheduling and triggering the environment</li>
<li>reusing components from the model training,
like data transformation and feature engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sagemaker is a great tool for machine learning,
but it won‚Äôt take you all the way.</p>
</div>
<div id="sagemaker-r-package" class="section level2">
<h2>sagemaker R package</h2>
<p>So how does the new sagemaker R package fit into this?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
First and foremost, the sagemaker R package is an interface
to the AWS Sagemaker API. This means that it‚Äôs easier to build
a <em>predictions pipeline environment</em> using R.</p>
<p>You can do all your data maniuplation and cleaning from R,
as well as manage your Sagemaker APIs.</p>
<p>Second, I think this R package vastly simplifies the Sagemaker interface,
especially during model training and evaluation.
It‚Äôs easier to compare hyperparameters across tuning jobs,
and make predictions on new data.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I‚Äôve tried to hide a lot of the details that
get in the way when you are trying to quickly spin up a Sagemaker
model. Less boilerplate, more machine learning.</p>
<div id="what-to-watch-out-for" class="section level3">
<h3>What to watch out for</h3>
<p>This package has been built for and tested on the xgboost Sagemaker models.
I spent most of my time working with xgboost, so I‚Äôve even included
shortcuts for xgboost like
<code>sagemaker_xgb_container</code> and <code>sagemaker_xgb_estimator</code>.</p>
<p>However, this means there are a lot of models and features of Sagemaker
I might not have come across.
If for whatever reason, something in <code>sagemaker</code> doesn‚Äôt work
leave an issue here: <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/sagemaker/issues" class="uri">https://github.com/tmastny/sagemaker/issues</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-next" class="section level3">
<h3>What‚Äôs next</h3>
<p>I have plans to extend the sagemaker R package in various ways.
I really like Sagemaker and R,
and I think there are many small improvements that could be made
to the interface to help with some everyday stuff.</p>
<p>Things like a <code>type</code> parameter on <code>predict</code> for probability or class,
default objective metrics based on the dataset‚Äôs outcome,
and better intergration with named data frames.</p>
<p>I also have bigger projects I want to tackle.
Cross-validation seems like a huge missing feature from Sagemaker,
but something that I think is possible to implement on my own.</p>
<p>And as always,
I‚Äôll keep developing and maintaining functionality
as I build more models.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The Sagemaker API calls it batch
transform, because technically you can use it for generic transforms.
However, in my experience this process is not well documented and there
are better solutions in my opinion.
