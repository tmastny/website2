<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Inspired, but dissatified by <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/whats-your-blogdown-workflow-to-include-work-from-other-projects/1445">this discussion</a> on the RStudio’s forum, I’d like to share my workflow to blog about my projects using Hugo/blogdown/Netlify.</p>
<p>Here’s the scenario: I’m working on my project, using a git repo to track changes. I’m excited about the project or a certain result, and I’d like to tell everyone about it by making a blog post with blogdown.</p>
<p>But how do I utilize all the work I’ve already done in the project? I’ve curated the data, built the plots, and saved my complicated analysis as a <a href="https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2012/04/01/saving-and-loading-r-objects/"><code>.RDS</code> file</a>. I’d like to reuse that work, and as a one forum user put it “copying rmarkdown files is a nonstarter.”</p>
<p>My proposal is to use git, in particular <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git submodules</a>, along with knitr <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/externalization/">code externalization</a> to faciliate the reuse of code when writing blog posts.</p>
<p>I’ll work through this by example. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/tmastny/git-blogdown-workflow">Github repo</a> I created for this blog post. The scripts and data within the repo will be the external project we’d like to blog about.</p>

<h2>git Setup</h2>
<p>For our purposes, we’ll assume your project repo exists Github. I strongly recommend Jenny Bryan’s bookdown on <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/index.html">git for R users</a> if you would like a tutorial on working with git locally and on Github.</p>
