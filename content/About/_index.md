# About

My name is Tim Mastny and I'm a software engineer at [Wave](https://www.wave.com/en/), 
building life-changing financial infrastructure for developing countries in Africa. 
I'm based out of Omaha, Nebraska.

I have a wife Michaela and a son Desmond. 
My wife owns a small business and a non-profit. 
She's a [competitive powerlifter](https://www.instagram.com/michaelalifts_/profilecard/?igsh=MW5ocDV4ODhsY2k1bw%3D%3D),
and I help coach and support her as much as I can.
Desmond is a toddler. He teaches me how to play and I try to teach him
not to throw things. 

Hobbies and interests:
* indoor rock climbing. I love the collaborative, problem-solving aspects of it. 
  My best send is a "gym" v10.
* science fiction and fantasy books: Lies of Locke Lamora, Game of Thrones,
  and Wizard of Earthsea 
* video games: 
  * [Exapunks](https://store.steampowered.com/app/716490/EXAPUNKS/): a must play for anyone
    with in interest in assembly programming, operating systems, and hacking. 
    My favorite game of all time.
  * Dark Souls: all of the soulsborne games are incredible, but this was my first. 
    Like rock climbing, it's the difficult yet collaborative nature of the game (and genre)
    that appeals to me.
  * Others: Her Story, Alan Wake II, The Witness
* Studying mathematics and computer science and engineering 
  * The Art of Probability by Richard Hamming 
  * Some of the MIT courses are incredible: [6.1810](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/),
    [6.5840](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2023/), [6.004](https://computationstructures.org). 
    I like these courses because they are project basd and have automated 
    grading systems for instant feedback.
  
I also dabble in chess, go, piano, and I read a lot of non-fiction too.

I'm happy to chat over email or coffee.

## Background

The first videogame I ever saw was Super Mario 64 when I was 6 years old
and it absolutely blew my mind. As a child my favorite games were
Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
My middle school years overlapped with the golden age of MMOs, 
so I spent thousands of hours in Runescape and World of Warcraft.

During high school, my interests drifted from videogames and technology
as I focused on competitive speech and debate, qualifying for the
national tournament my senior year. The lessons I learned about public speaking,
attention to detail, adversarial and scholarly research really grew me as a person.
But there were also skills that served me well in debate I had to
unlearn in the professional world: being argumentative, overly
critical, and monologuing.

I graduated with a degree in Mathematics with a concentration in 
Electrical Engineering, but my majors changed from Crimonology,
Anthropology, and Geology along the way. 

During college, I had a keen interest in aerospace, interning as 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for 3 summers. 
I was fortunate enough to be there during both the discovery of the
Higgs Boson and the landing of the Curiosity Rover on Mars.
I personally worked on automating electromagnetic compatiability testing
systems for the [GOES-R](https://www.goes-r.gov) weather satellite
and the [Low-Density Supeesonic Decelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Density_Supersonic_Decelerator) 
(LDSD) project.

My first job out of college was at Boeing, where I developed an interest in
data engineering and analytics. After working there for a short period of time,
I returned to Nebraska to study statistics full-time at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.
There I discovered R, open source software and science, and Bayesian statistics.

These became my primary areas of interest for the next few years. 
I contributed to many open source R projects and developed a few of my own.
I also honed my analytics skills with a focus on Bayesian analysis. 
Most of these efforts are documented on my projects page or in my blog posts.

Next I worked at Hudl, a company specializing in sports analytics software 
and technology, working on their internal data science team. 
The work I'm most proud of there is Hudl's Greatest Comebacks, which was a analytics
tool to search for exciting moments in football games. 

Then I pivoted to fintech working for Bread. Working in that space
lead me to [Wave](https://www.wave.com/en/). Before Wave,
I honestly took banking and finance for granted. 
But it's actually a life-changing product and I'm excited
to bring useful, affordable financial infrastructure to Africa.

These days my technical focus at work is on data engineering and infrastructure.
