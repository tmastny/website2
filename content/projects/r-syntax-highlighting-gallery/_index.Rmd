I collected examples of R sytnax highlighting when I was
searching for the a highlighter to use on this site.

I settled on [settled on prism](https://github.com/tmastny/hugo-xmin/blob/857952f21bd1b7c42ea7951e6d9c3380143126ad/sass/prism-vs.scss#L1-L4).
I also wrote [this blog post](/blog/syntax-highlighting) on syntax highlighting.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,
                      results='show', cache=FALSE, autodep=FALSE, error = TRUE)
```

```{css}
body {
	max-width: 1200px;
}
```
