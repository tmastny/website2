A few years ago, I was searching for a good R syntax highlighter for this site.
I collected various examples in this gallery.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,
                      results='show', cache=FALSE, autodep=FALSE, error = TRUE)
```

```{css}
body {
	max-width: 1200px;
}
```
